[{"source": "YouTube: The Exotic \"Backfire\" SMG is the NEW META in the Division 2! (This Build is INSANE)", "content": " For the last few days, my chat had been telling me to play with the backfire SMG, and I had been holding off because, you know, I just kind of wanted to wait a little bit until we had all the season modifiers unlocked. But I was definitely ready to dive into it today. And I'll tell you, this might be one of the craziest SMGs in year 7, Season 1. And it's not even a new SMG. It is the exotic backfire. And with this build, it literally was shredding through legendary content. Now, this was a fourman legendary run, and we finished it in about 16 minutes. And the amount of damage I was putting out was pretty crazy to see. But that's not even the crazier part. The crazier part is how tanky I was and how much damage I was still able to put out. I even ran this in heroic countdown and we even ran it in a few other heroic missions, which I'll show you some gameplay in a little bit. But I'll tell you, I just don't know if there is going to be a better weapon to run than the Backfire in season 1 of year 7. So, let's get into it and I'll show you guys how I have this set up with all the modifiers you need so that way you can take advantage of the Backfire SMG. So, for the weapon, we are running the Backfire. And the reason why is because this is probably one of the most insane SMGs at the moment with the current modifiers. And a lot of people stay away from this weapon, including myself, because of the way the backfire works. But, but with the modifier, you can have zero bleedback and just shred through enemies as you guys were seeing. So, on this one, I do have it fully optimized. We have 15% SMG damage, 21% crit chance, and 10% damage targets out of cover. Now, the accuracy on this is pretty bad, but the stability isn't. The reload time is 1.67, which isn't bad at all. Now, if we look at the talent, payment of kind, dealing damage with the enemy also stacks up 2% critical hit damage up to 100 times. That means you can have up to 200% extra critical hit damage on this build, lasting 10 seconds. On reload, it applies a 10-second bleed to yourself, which deals 0.5% armor damage per stack. But we don't have to worry about this because we're going to have zero bleed. Now, what I like to use is the ACS. You guys can run any ACS you want if you have the rock and roll. I run this one. It has zero expertise. Shotgun damage, damage to armor, health damage, and then I have preservation, killing enemy, repairs 10% of your armor or 5 seconds. If I get a head shot, that's an additional 10%. Now, this isn't made to kill. This is made to build my stack up. I want to have full stacks with the striker builds because that's how I'm going to be putting out max damage. We have 12% weapon handling and 14% reload speed. Now, we are running the striker battery chest piece and that's going to give us 15% weapon handling. We also going to get 15% rate of fire. Now, the four piece for striker's gamble give us weapon hits increase total weapon damage by 65 stacks up to 100 times. Now, one stack lost per second between zero and 50 and two stacks lost per second between 50 and 100. We are actually going to be doubling that because we're going to increase it by running the chest piece. And what that does is increases max stacks from 100 to 200. So, three stacks lost per second for between 100 and 200. But with this build and the ACS, we're able to keep up that stack at full stacks a lot. And that's what really matters with this build. We do have armor on this, Hasbro, and then critical chance. The reason why you're going to want to have H haspro on the pieces is because we want that 100%. Now, some people decide to run the Striker without any Hasbro, and the reason why is because you can still get about 60% has protection and you'll just have a little bleed. For the holster, we went with the Striker holster. We have Armor and Hasbro. For our third piece of strikers, we have the knee pads, armor, Hasbro, the striker battle gear gloves, armor, Hasbro. So, you're going to have Hasbro on all of the Striker pieces. If you look at the backpack, we have the Momento backpack. We have weapon damage, armor, skill tier, and then we have 12% critical damage on here. Now, the reason why this is so good is because, remember, we're going to have the short stack, which is going to give us 5% weapon damage, but 60% bonus armor and 5% skill efficiency. But once we build up that 30 stack, what does that do? 30% weapon damage, 30% skill efficiency, and 3% armor regen. And we're going to be healing a lot, sitting at 1.9 million armor. Yes, we are a tank with this build. For the mask, we went with the hollow man mask. This is going to give us 10% hazard protection. It is the only piece in the Division 2 that has 10% hazard protection as a one piece. And that's why it's good. Whether you guys have this piece or you guys have a regular Personally, I really want a regular Yao gear piece. And I would have armor on here, but instead of the health damage, I would love to stack more crit damage, but the health damage isn't bad. But again, armor, health damage, hazard protection, and then critical damage mod is what you want to go on there. For the modifiers, we went with assault link. The reason why we went with assault link is because your firearms attributes is set to tier five. For every duration of the ability, you gain 5% weapon damage for every non- red core on this build. And that's why we're going to get a ton of extra weapon damage there. Now attributes are frozen and bonuses are multiplied by four and then the passive modifier values are multiplied by two. Now the duration on this is going to last 25 seconds and the cool down is 60. Now safety first allows you to stack 7.5% extra hazard protection on your build for each stamina bar putting us at an additional 37.5% extra hazard protection on this build. You go over here you have loaded up. You have 25% of your crit chance value is added to crit your critical hit damage while at tier five. So once I proc the active modifier, I will be getting an additional 50% critical hit damage. And then if we go over here, we have best of a kind. While you're at least tier three in both firearms and stamina, you gain 2.5% headshot damage for every 100,000 total armor you have. Now, if you do not want to run this because you want to run a little bit more survivability, which I was actually running for some of my gameplay, you guys can go with extra padding. Gain 5% protection from elites per blue core. Now, if you look at our stats, we're sitting at 54% crit chance and 84% crit damage. We're going to have 70% headshot damage, 14% health damage. And then we'll come over here. We have 1.8 million, almost 1.9 million. But look at our hazard protection, 100%. What that means is no bleed, no blind, no burn, no destroyer, no disrupt, no ins snare, no poison, and no shock. Obviously, we are rocking Haspro machine with this build. And I actually love this because of how the season modifiers really allow you to do this. And what I want to show you real quick is and without using our assault link, we're sitting at 284% crit damage. And then when we do use it, we're sitting at 92% crit chance. And that's why this is actually pretty crazy to see how this all works when you have it all working together. And after playing this build for a few hours today, I will have to say this is probably one of the meta builds for this year. I honestly can't see another build that's going to put out this type of DPS with this amount of armor, 1.9 million armor, and just shredding through enemies. It just wasn't even close. Whether it was on legendary, whether it was on heroic missions or heroic countdown, I felt it was just too easy. And and honestly, the chat couldn't stop asking, \"Yo, Skills, what builds?\" Even though I just kept telling them it was a striker has pro build. They couldn't believe it. So, this is the build right here. full build breakdown. If you guys want to see more gameplay of this, my VOD from this stream is still live over on twitch.tv/ somethingkills. You guys can even see the 16minute legendary run with randoms. Pretty insane to see. All right, guys. I'm going to wrap this one up, but again, definitely give this build a try and then let me know if you do and what you guys think. I'll see you in the next one. Hey, nothing but skills out. [Music] Hey, hey,"}, {"source": "YouTube: The Division 2 in 2025", "content": " Hey everyone, welcome back. Today we're going to be revisiting The Division 2. It's been 7 years since the game's initial release, and in that time they've gotten numerous patches and updates. Just last week, they launched one of their biggest DLCs titled Battle for Brooklyn. This coincides with the start of a brand new season. And with this, they've introduced a new narrative content and map locations to explore for the first time since 2020. As the name implies, Battle for Brooklyn also takes us back to New York. This time exploring some new locations and burrows, and it's also set in a new season for the franchise. It's fall, so get out your pumpkin spice lattes or whatever. This comes with some new and returning favorite gameplay stuff as well, like mobile cover makes a return and an additional endgame mode to check out. Now, Ubisoft reached out to sponsor a video for the update. I played myself for a few afternoons checking out some of the newest stuff. had a good time and we'll be sharing that with you here today. If you guys like what you see here, there is of course a link available below. But yeah, Division 2 Battle for Brooklyn, here's a look at it. Well, I'm just going to jump into it. We're going to be playing some of the Division 2 today. They had an update a few days ago. Didn't know Division 2 servers were still online. Dude, they're still getting regular updates. It definitely seems like one of those games that's probably does quite well on console. And I don't know, dude. That game was just so and the full open world thing. It's like when I was I was talking about it with when we were playing Dune recently during the beta. I was like people don't make games like this third person shooters that are like open shared worlds where you'll see other people. It's it's the combination of the full open world with little to no loading screens with the third person shooter gameplay mix in some abilities with that. Division has abilities do and has like abilities and or spells and then the loot stuff. It's just like I wish we got more thirdp person shooter openw world MMO lights. I just love them so much when they're done even like semicompetently. I wish I just wish we got more. Now, one of the first things that stood out to me as it has in the past with this game and its predecessor are the visuals. I got to just say every time I come back to this game, even if I just play for like a couple hours, I'm always just like blown away by the both the level and the amount of detail. And like the lighting's pretty good, too. Like just like look at this [\u00a0__\u00a0] dude. It's great. It looks great. It really does. You could look at this and this could be like a single player corridor shooter and you'd be like, \"That looks pretty good.\" But then when you realize it's a fully seamless open world and you could just walk down every street that's in the literal city that they've recreated. Ubisoft has a lot of things you can complain about, but the one thing that's definitely really impressive is the scale and level of detail of the worlds they've created it. And you can even say their games are too big. And I wouldn't really disagree, but the way they've managed like how they create assets with all the different tools that they have and the fact that they can just like literally put you in these worlds, the actual like square footage one for one in a fictionalized version, but nevertheless, like I'm walking through New York City right now in the fall time. Like that's actually happening. You got a shield? I got a shield. What now? I got a shield. I can hit you with mine, too. I can't dodge with my shield up, huh? That's interesting. So, after walking around for a little while and just checking stuff out, I decided to go engage with some of my favorite type of content in these kinds of games, and that is clearing points of interest, taking out enemies, and doing world events. So, I don't know what we're doing. We're trying to We're in New York. We're trying to rescue someone, secure the area. Okay, so we got zone control here. This guy's got a big drone on his back. He does. Not going anywhere. You got an agent inbound. He He was staring at me. I thought he was looking in the opposite direction. A flamethrower boss. Look at him. Oh my god, dude. That thing's got some distance. I am on fire. You want to flank while I We got some weak points there. He's got something on his back, too. Can go around here. Oh, he's actually literally There we go. And while doing this, I noticed something sort of uh familiar. I had a bit of deja vu. This looks like, you guys remember that First Division gameplay trailer? They walk up and there's guys coming out of the the door and the roof and they go against the car and they walk along and they're like, he closed the door with his hand. Do you guys remember that trailer? And we were all just like, \"What? They How' they do that? It's literally the same place, is it? It's been so long I don't [\u00a0__\u00a0] remember.\" Now, beyond being a shooter, if you didn't know, The Division 2 is also very much a loot driven game. In fact, they've got fullblown gear sets uh from the early game all the way up to endame. So, you can see that the the set types, there's the item name at the very top, and then there's the set, and then there is the core attribute displayed on this on this thing. So, you can see the set if you have multiple of a set based on the second thing. So, this is the Fender Group AB set. This is the Cesca Vroa SRO set, the Bellstone Armory, and then I got a couple more. You know, I've got multiple because I do have the set. So, this is a Providence defense set, which would give on the right side, it shows when you have the bonuses. Headshot damage, crit hit chance, crit hit damage. That sound pretty good, dude. Okay, so I saved you and now I'm going to secure one police plaza. Got it. Getting back into the swing of things, I was once more reminded how much I love some of the defensive abilities that they have in this game. In particular, that shield. Man, I loved this shield. And I also love that it just snaps out and you can toss it to your side and it only uses what damage you take. So, you can keep doing it. Like, you can keep tossing it out. It's really nice. There's a few different kinds of shields. Like, there's one that you can only use a pistol for, but it prevents more damage. But this one's the greatest because it lets you use your primary weapon. Oh, I forgot that I got my super weapon. This thing. Got to use this. All right, there's our coordinates. We are at the bridge. Uh, presumably the Brooklyn Bridge as we are in Brooklyn. All right, so let's see. We got some Check the map here. Do I only have Okay, so there's a few question marks over in Dumbo. Is that the main mission, the Sarah Clinic? I think so. I'm guessing we're going to discover POIs in route to there. Is there anything for me to do here and the base? It has been a long time since I've played. So, there is a lot that I just don't. And shortly after arriving at the first settlement, I set out on a bounty hunt. And as the name implies, and as you might expect, this has you chasing down a target. Either systems I never encountered or don't really understand. There's got some bounties. Powell bounty. Activate bounty. So, I can go hunt this guy. I've got 15 minutes to go hunt this guy. Let's go take a look. Elite territory control. Is that where he is or is that Oh, this is another one. Well, let's do my objective because I only have 13 minutes to kill this guy. It is nice that they let us just like get a character boost for this update because gameplaywise after you've played for a couple hours the base game, it kind of plays the same. And to be honest, the base overworld is not very challenging. I know the hard stuff comes like in the group content and there's difficulty tiers that you can push up and stuff, but like just going around the open world and it's like, okay, you know what I mean? So, it's nice get considering that it's a paid update. It's nice that they actually um they they did that so if people come back, they don't have to play through the base campaign if they want to jump straight in. And and like I was saying though, it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. This is the same game I remember playing. I don't feel other than like the new systems they get introduced. So, for example, I'm doing this thing where I'm trying to hunt this guy, right? I don't know if this is part of the expansion or if this is a system. I'm guessing it's an older system because the game didn't guide me to it. I just came across it in the settlement. That's I'd say probably one of the only things that's kind of a struggle when you come back to a game after so long is when there have been seven years of updates. It's just kind of a lot to parse. You know what I'm saying? So, where is he? Down here. I don't that's the thing. I don't know. Is he down? He must be, right? Seems like there have been a lot of changes. I mean that there like so much of the game is new from what I remember or at least varied from what I remember. The core gameplay is still the same. He's up he's up above, isn't he? Is the new content as amazing as I hope it is so far? I mean, I'm liking like going through the New York thing. I'm just kind of going around on missions and, you know, groups of enemies come out, I kill them, and then new ones come out and I kill them. I'm curious to see uh any new systems or whatever, but it's still it's cool playing this game in a new setting. You know what I mean? Oh, he's Okay, he's in here. He's in here finally. Okay, got his backpack blowing up. All right, I did it. Thank god. I really wasn't sure what was happening. Looks like you earned yourself another bounty. Well done. After taking on my target, I found my first full-blown set item, which is something that I worked towards as I continued playing. And I got a green item. These are set gear. Like, these are full-on sets. Red, white, and blue. Every two seconds, enemies you shoot have a stacking debuff. Red amplifies enemy damage taken. white shooting the enemy repairs. So that's like really cool. Usually four plus two or three plus three. Ah, usually you want four or three pieces of the gear set green gear and then mix in the other two slots. If you want everything from the set though, you need four for the four piece. Okay. But ultimately we do want to go for a four piece. Okay. All sets are good as long as it's striker. Yeah. I mean it's kind of hard to just be like flat baseline weapon shooting increase. I think I saw somewhere there was like a bullet point of all of the things with the update. One brand new set and one new gear set. Um, I want to check real quick because I saw like a list of all of the new stuff in this update. New enemies, unlockable skills, including the return of smart cover, exclusive catalyst exotic mask. Battle for Brooklyn lays the foundation of what's next for Division 2. DLC launched on May 27th, which is two days ago. More modifiers. This season's global modifier is hard-core. Bring in new build focus bonuses for yourself and your allies to grow based on gear cores. Doesn't that I I think when I was going to create a character, I think I saw that they have a hardcore mode in this game now. I don't know when they added it, but it's literally like hardcore like you get one life. If you die, you're done. There are three hostile modifiers in the form of colored marks offering enemy buffs. Enemies can spawn with one, two, or three of the unique marks at once, but they cannot game the same mark twice. You get special rewards for engaging with marked enemies. There are manouse scouts. There's the seasonal journey with different stuff. Gear, weapons, and talents. Gear up for new build opportunities. This season brings two new named weapons, several new talents, and fresh additions. New exotic weapon. The pan RPK74. Was that not a weapon? Was that in the original? Am I remembering this pan from the first division? It was in division one. Okay, that's where I remember it from then. Funny. Player onboarding improvements easier for new engines to learn the ropes. Ground running onboarding feature milestone builds. Oh, I saw that. So, I made a fresh character. Uh I I was just playing through the base campaign yesterday. I made a fresh character and as you level up, they give you like gear caches where they just have like the starting of a basic build. So, they'll give you like three pieces of a build and be like, \"Hey, these are how builds work. Here is a build. It was like level eight, level 15, something like that. It went up as you leveled up, but they basically introduce you to builds, which is really smart. Level 40 boost for a fresh new character and there's new season pass. Okay. All right. Um, what was I doing? Literally, time passed and it's night time in the game. And as mentioned, the expansion comes with a whole bunch of new narrative content. So, I started making my way towards one of those. I guess we'll just go work on our quest. Yeah. The only real hospital left inrooklyn. We have medics and field triage, but the maternity ward and surgical center, that's the clinic. Oh, you know what? There was a hostile POI that I uncovered right here. Let's go to that. These are I always really like these. So, just literally enemy points of interest. Territory control. You go in there, you there's usually some minor objective like stop a radio broadcast, defeat the leader, zone control, stuff like that. in Route. However, I got distracted by, you guessed it, doing side content. But also, it was at this time that I found out that the game had multiple ways to ramp up the difficulty challenge with both global difficulty settings as well as directives that you can enable. And this made a big difference. Did they ever bring back world tiers, by the way? They're tiered from normal, hard, challenge, and heroic. World tiers are gone. Now, the world scales to you, but there are world difficulties. Let me look at the bottom. Global settings zed. change global difficulty. They literally have what I'm asking for. What if I did normal with all directives? Reduce starting ammo and excess ammo is lost on reload. Enemies don't drop ammo and ammo is not. Wow, that sounds awful. Cool skills. When one skill is activated, the other is put on cool down. Actually, don't hate that. That seems fine. Ragers. Killing an enemy fills the rage meter of nearby hostiles. Rage depletes over time. Full rage meter makes enemies enrage, which grants overheal. Killing an enraged enemy removes all the rage from nearby hostiles. An empty rage meter makes an enraged enemy return to normal. All right, let me try all. Yeah, I don't like ammo hoarders, but I'm kind of okay with the rest of these, except for maybe fog of war is kind of annoying. But what if I do all but on normal? Do I need to reset? Oh, reset. Changing global settings. Okay, here we go. I would like it if there was an option to ramp up the campaign difficulty and you know make it so that it's not just harder but it's also like so it's harder to take down enemies but you get more experience. I'm a little ner I'm a little nervous now even with the modifiers if normal is still way too easy I'll bump it up one more. I'm just curious. I want to find the sweet spot for combat where it's not face roll but I also don't want to be getting two shot. So, I think going hard would be more ideal. Do you? Okay. Well, before we get too far in it, let's try that then. Are you enjoying the DLC? It's It's been cool going through so far. Yeah, I'm enjoying it. Ramping up the difficulty was the right choice. Pretty much immediately it felt more engaging to me, the combat. Yeah. I mean, this is already a little bit bit more engaging. Even these basic enemies even take a second, you know? It's good. I like it. Hostile control point nearby. This is this that must be it, right? Is this game still active? I mean, it definitely has a consistent player base, otherwise they wouldn't be releasing updates still. I don't know how much of that is PC versus console. I would actually assume this game would have like a a console player base. It's the kind of game. It's a very kind of dad game. And I say that lovingly cuz I I like it. It's my kind of jam, you know. Third person looter shooter. That thing is no joke up there. Can we kill Can we not destroy it? Cuz I'm not seeing a health bar. Man, I love love love this shield that you can still use an assault rifle with. Well, any primary weapon, not just an assault rifle. Does it destroy my turret? Can I disable this garbage? You got Is that explosive? No, it's not. Follow the yellow wires. Thank you. Oh, there we go. It was right there. Okay. Is the year one pass worth it or should you get a gold edition for \u20ac11 less without the year 1 pass? Isn't it always better to just buy the cheapest version possible, see if you like it, and then decide from there if you want to spend more money? Cuz you can always buy the pass after, right? Yeah. Let me pop my shield and see if my drone disappears. Okay, it doesn't. I kind of realized I think I've really vacated the play space. Oh my lord. Oh my lord. Oh my Oh my Yeah, thank you. Thank you for telling me about these diff these world difficulty settings because it is definitely way more engaging when enemies don't just go down in two bullets of an assault rifle. Clearing this control point gets a supply room. Get some loot in here. All right. Uh excuse me. What are you guys doing here? We just took this. You kidding me? Okay. Okay, so we took that control point. Oh, there's more back here. Look, look, look. Cleaners, public execution, territory control. [\u00a0__\u00a0] I want to go back and get those real quick. Cleaner lock box. I think I had I think I picked up a key. It might have been for that. Maybe that's why it's showing up on my map. Let's go see what that is. I think that's another true patriot thing. It is true patriot backpack. All right. So now I got three pieces, one more true patriot drop, and I'm going to try this full set. It was at this point that I finally made my way towards the main story quest, the one that I intended to start doing some 60 minutes prior. My goal here, take out some bad guys. Same as always, right? Thank you for coming, agent. We need you to sweep for survivors and secure the clinic. Cleaners on site. Too far, AR. It does. Dude, this shield is so good. You know what, too? I have not used my uh special weapon like at all. I'll do it next time there's a big group like is is this just infinite? I always worry in these encounters if there's something I'm supposed to be doing and the enemies will just keep coming otherwise. I did bump up the difficulty. So, I'm getting what I asked for. Then after that, I was about to head to the next story mission, but then I found some more side content to do. All right, so we finished that mission. Our next mission is right over here. Stuff going on over here. Maybe we could go do some of that. Okay, so this is a propaganda broadcast. Uh, these I remember from the base game. In fact, I think they're the ones that I recall. Yeah, there's propaganda broadcast, territory control, public execution, and territory control. I liked the I like the territory controls the most. They they've always been the most interesting in terms of the encounters. Well, maybe I'll do this one and then head to that one and see what happens to the remaining two. Oh, that's just a full-on control point. Okay. And does that feed these other side activities? Like does the control point cause is that actually causing those two to show up? You can make the point weaker by doing the linked ones, right? Oh, all right. So, these ones, these public broadcast, there's literally a broadcast happening. There's a speaker and I need to override it. And then some enemies come. The my overriding process gets interrupted and I've got to manually re-engage it. This guy's literally climbing out of the manhole while the cover's still on. So, I had cleared all of those connected events that fed into a control point. And as it turns out, that made the control point much stronger. And that was a mistake. It didn't take long for me to figure that one. Every connect activity you complete increases the CP level. Stronger, not weaker. Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] agent decease. I'm sorry, who suggested that I bump up the difficulty on this control point? Did the game be on an expansion or something? Correct. Yep. Um, new Brooklynbased expansion. We are back to New York. Uh, there was the Warlords of New New York update. This one is Brooklyn based. Oh, shoot. I got to clear these guys first. Dude, I am literally screwed. Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] Call for reinforcements. Replenish my armor. Stay behind cover. All these guys are yellows. Oh my god, dude. Immediate assistance needed. I'm never empowering one of these control points again. Oh my god, look at my max armor. I think it'd be different if I didn't also have all these modifiers on, but like holy crap. Getting my max armor reduced like this is just absolutely brutal. Someone told me this is the easy part. Wonderful. I'm behind cover. Why does fire still work? I know, like technically it would, but my dear god, I'm I'm I'm so dead. Control points get more difficult if you do the world events that are linked to them. I know this is my this is my proof. People told me that, but I was like, how much harder can it be? And so I did all three and I found out it can be significantly harder. Uh I almost just fell to my death. Bro, can my AI res me? Actually, you know what? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You can do it. No, no, no. Put the stupid Put the gun away. Thank you. Oh my Oh my. It even gives me back some of my max armor. Oh, you're on fire. I'm so sorry about that. I will I promise I will res you if you get downed. Just stick with Damn it all the hell. Could you res me, please? How we doing, guys? How's How we doing here? You guys got this under control. I need to shut off that flamethrower. One second, guys. Coming through. Okay, shut that flamethrower off. Keep the high ground up here and try to get some of these idiots. I got my big bombie. Blow them up. Blow them up. Blow them up. There you go. Now we're gaming. There's still [\u00a0__\u00a0] Another one. Enemy leader detected. Okay, so let's get the officer up. I think I can do this. I actually legitimately appreciate that it's difficult because honestly, the best thing for my experience here was bumping up the world. I think we're going to take a break for now. But this has been pretty fun. Um enjoyed coming back and checking out some more of The Division. There's definitely a lot to parse, right? Like having not played this game pretty much since release. There's a lot of systems that have been added over time or even just ones that I missed at initial release to try to figure out. But if nothing else, it's cool to see the new setting. I like I like the New York setting, obviously. I I really liked the First Division. All righty. Well, that does it for today's video. Thanks again to Ubisoft for sponsoring this. If you guys enjoyed what you saw and would like to check out Battle for Brooklyn's DLC for yourself, check out that link in the description below. But otherwise, thank you as always for watching. Hope you enjoyed and I'll see you next time. Take it easy."}, {"source": "YouTube: The Division 2 - TOP 3 BEST SOLO DPS Legendary STRIKER HYBRID PVE Builds For Year 7 Season 1! (2025)", "content": " cover right here. Target coming up here. We know that mess you up. [Music] Hello guys, welcome and welcome back to another Division 2 video. So today we're going to be breaking down three viable hybrid striker builds for solo players, but these builds will also work well for team play. Now, I've said this plenty of times before in previous videos, but Striker is easily the strongest DPS gear set in the Division 2. So now, just imagine having a decent amount of healing on top of the heavy damage from Striker. Now you have a powerhouse hybrid striker build with high survivability. And since there's self-healing, you won't have to use as many armor kits. So these three setups have healing capabilities. And with the help of some of the new hardcore seasonal modifiers, you know, like tech upgrades, supportive, just to name a few, the healing is that much better. So guys, without further ado, let's get started. This first hybrid setup utilizes the striker vest and harnesses the power of the exotic Momento backpack. Many of you guys should already be familiar with the Momento backpack, but it's a super viable piece, mainly because it provides both a short and long-term buff as well as stat bonuses that support and enhance all three major core attributes. So, no matter what role you're playing, you know, whether you're healing, DPSing, or what have you, uh you're going to benefit from this backpack. It's a very effective piece to use for hybrid setups. So, it's going to help increase overall damage and healing as well as provide your agent with a decent amount of armor regeneration. And this is all thanks to the skill efficiency and weapon damage bonuses that you're getting. Not only coming from the short-term buff, but from the long-term buff as well. So, it's a pretty solid setup, and it will definitely hold up well for the new Brooklyn content, as well as higher difficulty activities such as heroic or legendary. So, for the primary weapon, I'm using the Lexington high-end assault rifle with the talent future perfect. And with future perfect, you're basically getting an extra skill tier per weapon kill for 15 seconds. This is great because that's only going to increase the effectiveness of the healing. And since I have three skill tiers with this setup, reaching max stacks with this talent will bring me to six skill tiers. Then any kill after that will grant overcharge for 15 seconds. Now, if you don't have the Lexington, the Carbine 7 is a great alternative because it has very similar stats with a slightly higher base damage, but the Police M4 or the F2000 are also great options. In fact, most of these ARs that you can craft here at the crafting station are great options considering you have the blueprint for them. So, just take your pick, you know, based on whatever weapon you prefer using, then roll the talent future perfect on it. For the mask, a striker mask with armor, critical hit damage, and a crit hit chance mod. Then for the vest, a striker vest rolled with armor, critical hit chance, and another critical hit chance mod. And for the holster, an elps summit piece for the 18% repair skill, one piece bonus with skill tier, and both critical hit chance and damage. Then for the knee pads, uh, striker knee pads with skill tier and critical hit chance. Just a quick thing to note if you're a beginner, striker pieces will always drop with weapon damage as its core attribute since it's designed for a DPS. So you want to make sure you have either crit hit chance or damage already rolled on here. So you can just roll the core attribute to skill tier. For the gloves, striker gloves with armor and critical hit damage. Then for the backpack, the exotic momento bag. One great benefit of having this backpack is that it comes with all three major core attributes. So, I get weapon damage, armor, and the extra skill tier brings me to three. But not only that, but the talent it comes with makes this backpack super viable. So, with kill confirmed, enemies you kill will drop a trophy that you can collect. Collecting these trophies will build both a short and long-term buff. The short-term buff will scale to the number of core attributes you have equipped and last for 10 seconds. So, for example, if I were to collect a trophy after killing an NPC, I'll get a 5% weapon damage bonus since I have one weapon damage core attribute, then 40% bonus armor for having four armor core attributes, and finally 15% skill efficiency for having three skill tier attributes. So, I'm getting these bonuses per number of attributes that I have on my gear pieces, right? And that's for the short-term buff. So, keep in mind that you're stacking a long-term buff as well, which maxes out at 30 stacks. So, for the long-term buff, since you're getting 1% weapon damage and skill efficiency, as well as.1% armor regeneration per stack, well, once you've collected 30 trophies, you'll be at 30% weapon damage and skill efficiency, as well as 3% armor regeneration. So, that helps out big time with the healing and overall damage. Now, Striker, just like any other gear or brand set, provides stat bonuses for having pieces equipped. For three pieces, you get 15% weapon handling and rate of fire. And for four pieces, you get the striker's gamble gear set talent. So, weapon hits increase total weapon damage by 65% stacking up to 100 times. So, if you were to land 100 shots, you'll be at 65% increased weapon damage. And since I have the vest equipped, that amount gets doubled because max stacks get increased to 200. Now, for the skills, I'm currently using the fixer drone and mener seeker mine for the additional healing. However, feel free to swap out at least one of these for something that fits your play style better. But everyone's play style is different. So, if you're the type that uses cover more often than not, then either of the fortified or precision smart cover variants may suit you better. You can even go with the ballistic crusader shield for the additional survivability, which is one of my personal favorites because it provides you cover while you're mobile. But if you decide to go with the Menderseker mine, just know that it's only accessible from the survivalist weapon specialization. Uh the Mender Seeker mine is great because you actually get a decent amount of heals, especially once you get those additional skill tier bonuses per kill, right? Including the overcharge. you can really see some great healing. Also, just in case anyone didn't know this, but uh you can actually monitor the progress of your future perfect stacks while you're aiming down sight. So, that's pretty cool. Now, for the stats on the Lexington, 90,000 weapon damage with 52% critical hit chance and 103% critical hit damage. Even though the crit damage is a bit low, you're getting so much weapon damage from Striker. Plus, the momento increases your weapon damage as well, so that compensates for the low critical hit damage. And in case anyone's wondering, here are the mods on the Fixer Drone. So, duration, health, and armor repair. And for the Mender Seeker mine, uh, radius, health, and healing. Now, for the seasonal modifiers, I'm using broken link. And for the passive modifiers, I'm using loaded up tech upgrades and supportive. These last two modifiers are super viable with this setup. tech upgrades basically grants an increased skill duration of 25% of your critical hit damage value. So the more critical hit damage that you have, the higher the skill duration bonus. So this is going to help keep the fixer drone and mener seeker mine active for much longer, having more skill duration. And with the supportive modifier, your outgoing and incoming repairs are increased by 25% while you've reached at least tier three in both stamina and electronics. So, this is going to help out and make the healing from the Mender Seeker mine and fixer drone more potent. So, guys, this next hybrid setup takes advantage of the Ninjabike exotic backpack as well as the shiny monkey brand set, which is designed for a healer, but Ninjabike Backpack is another viable exotic piece that's great for putting together some very powerful hybrid builds. This setup has more healing than the previous, but slightly less damage since this build won't be using the striker vest. So, if you would like to have the extra healing and prefer not using the momento bag for whatever reason, then you may find this build favorable. It's extremely viable and you're going to find it super easy clearing heroic difficulty content. So, for the primary weapon, I'm using the Caretaker high-end assault rifle. This is basically a named enhanced G36. And as many of you guys already know, named weapons come with a perfected talent. So, the caretaker comes with perfect killer, which grants 90% critical hit damage after eliminating an enemy with a critical hit. This talent is absolutely amazing, and it's super viable with Striker because Striker doesn't provide any critical hit bonuses. Otherwise, Striker would be way too overpowered, right? Cuz Striker already offers so much raw weapon damage. But just in case anyone's wondering, you can actually get this weapon by completing the Game Pass event project. just make sure you do it soon because this project won't be here for much longer. Luckily for me though, I had a good friend help me get this weapon. But if you missed out on this event, no worries because more than likely this named weapon will be added to the general loot pool. So at that point, you'll be able to farm for it like any other weapon. But if any of you don't have this weapon, you can try the Carbine 7. Or if you have the blueprints, uh you can just craft a decent AR and roll the normal killer talent on it. The normal killer will grant you 70% critical hit damage instead of 90%. So just 20% less, which isn't too bad. I mean, it's better than nothing, right? And for the secondary weapon, um you can also use the ACS12 shotgun if you'd like to build striker stacks quickly. But for the mask, a striker mask with armor, critical hit damage, and a critical hit chance mod. And for the vest, a shiny monkey piece with skill tier, critical hit damage, repair skills, and a critical hit chance mod rolled with the talent obliterate. So landing crits will increase your total weapon damage by 1% for 10 seconds. And since this stacks at 20, you can get up to 20% increased weapon damage. So this is a really good talent for adding more damage. And for the striker holster, armor, and critical hit chance. Then for the knee pads, skill tier and critical hit chance. For the shiny monkey gloves, skill tier, critical hit damage, and repair skills. And last but not least, for the backpack, the ninjab bike exotic bag, which comes with all three major core attributes like momento. So you get weapon damage, armor, and skill tier. For those who are new, this exotic backpack basically serves as a slot holder in order to fulfill the requirements towards unlocking a brand or gear set bonus. So, in other words, the ninja bike bag serves as my fourth striker piece, as well as my third shiny monkey piece, allowing me to get all three stat bonuses. So, 15% skill duration, 5% skill efficiency, and 52% repair skills. Same thing with Striker. I get all the bonuses. So, this works for both gear and brand sets. Now for the skills, same as the previous setup. So the fixer drone and mender seeker mine for the additional healing. But again, everyone's play style is different. So feel free to swap out one of these skills if you prefer using something else like the ballistic crusader shield or revor hive for instance. However, I recommend having at least one healing skill. And for the stats, in case anyone's wondering, 52% critical hit chance, 91% critical hit damage, and um for the Fixer Drone, about 69,000 healing. So that's like 69,000 armor that gets healed back per second, right? And for the Mener Seeker mine, 81,000 healing and 20% skill haste. And for the global modifiers, the same as the previous setup. So, broken link for the active and for the passives, loaded up, tech upgrades, and supportive. The techlink active modifier may also be viable with this setup because if you have a look at what it does, it grants you 10% skill efficiency for every non yellow core attribute that you have equipped. And as many of you guys already know, skill efficiency will basically enhance the healing from your skills while increasing skill haste and duration. So, I don't know. I might be testing this out once I unlock it. But if anyone's tried this modifier yet, let me know what you guys think of it because I'm curious. Okay, guys. For this last hybrid striker build, I'm running the striker vest and backpack for the bonus talents to maximize weapon damage. So, this build utilizes the full power of striker. With the addition of both the striker vest and backpack, you can see some crazy damage at full striker stacks. I'm also running the um exotic catharsis mask. So, with the catharsis mask, not only will you be getting some decent healing, but your weapon damage will get increased even more. And you can get up to a 45% weapon damage increase with the catharsis mask, which is pretty crazy. However, this does come with a small catch. But for this build, I'm using the capacitor because it just deals out a crazy amount of damage with this setup. Plus, since I have three skill tiers on this build, I get an extra like 22% weapon damage thanks to the capacitance talon. So, this setup is better suited for you if you enjoy playing more aggressive. By having the ballistic crusader shield, it makes playing close-range easier because you won't have to worry about going down as often with the increased survivability from the ballistic shield. So, for the primary weapon, I'm currently running the capacitor, and it's easily one of the strongest weapons in the game. Like, not only is the base damage super high, but the weapon talent is amazing. So, with capacitance, you're basically getting an increased uh 7.5% weapon damage per skill tier. So, since I have three skill tiers with this setup, I'm getting an increased like 22% overall weapon damage or something like that. But for the secondary weapon, I highly recommend using the ACS12 shotgun if you have one, or even better, the rock and roll because it's going to help you reach max stacks a lot quicker, especially if you decide to run the striker vest. Now, for the mask, the catharsis mask with armor, incoming repairs, armor regen, and a critical hit chance mod. So, with the catharsis mask, taking damage will build stacks that cap at 30, and each stack will grant you 1.5% weapon damage. However, if you take damage once you reach full stacks, um there's a couple things that will happen. Well, for one, any status effect that has been applied to you will get removed while simultaneously triggering the release of a healing cloud that will actually restore 5% of your max armor for 10 seconds to you and any allies that are within this healing cloud. So, it has multiple functions, which makes it super viable. For the vest, a striker vest with armor, critical hit chance with a critical hit chance mod, and an arcade holster for the extra 15% incoming repairs, which stacks with the 20% that you get from the catharsis mask. And even though I have weapon handling on this piece, ideally, you'd want to have both crits. And for the knee pads, striker knee pads rolled with skill tier and critical hit chance. Then striker gloves rolled with armor and critical hit damage. Then for the striker backpack, armor with crits, so crit damage and a crit hit chance mod. So for those who didn't know, gear set backpacks and vests come with talents similar to brand sets. So for the striker backpack, I get the risk management talent, which increases the max stacks that you can gain from the striker's gamble talent from 65% to 90%. Which is a pretty nice jump. And with the addition of the striker vest, that amount gets doubled because remember with the press, the advantage talent, max stacks get increased from 100 to 200. Now, for the skills, I went with the ballistic crusader shield because since I'm using the striker vest, it's going to make building striker stacks a lot easier with the ACS12 since it's a close-range weapon. And for the secondary skill, the fixer drone for the additional healing. And for the stats, in case anyone's wondering, 52% critical hit chance and 111% critical hit damage on the capacitor. And for the ballistic shield, um about 77,000 active regeneration and 93,000 holstered regeneration. So, these are the values that the shield armor regenerates back per second while either equipped or holstered. And here are the mods on the ballistic shield and the fixer drone. This is praa.

And yeah, thanks for watching."}, {"source": "YouTube: Is The Division 2 Worth It In 2025?", "content": " Hey everyone, Rogue Gold here and today I'm going to attempt to answer the age-old question. Is it worth getting into XGAME in Year? Now, specifically, as you can probably tell by clicking on the video, we're going to be talking about Tom Clancy's The Division 2 in 2025. I have been getting asked this question a lot in the recent weeks, largely driven by the imminent release of the game's new DLC, Battle for Brooklyn. The uptick in marketing for it has caused quite a few heads to turn. Both those who played the game years ago but have been out of the loop since and those who have never played The Division before and are now interested. Regardless of which camp you may be in, it always loops back to that one central question. Is it worth it? Now, personally, I find this to be a very hard question to answer because what someone's criteria is for worth in video games could be entirely different from the next person. Is it worth my money? Is it worth my time? Is it fun? Is it grindy? Right? There's endless things people may mean or want to hear about when wondering if a game is worth it to them. So, all of that being said, in this video, I've decided to aim for a very simple objective. I'm going to lay out where The Division 2 is at in 2025, talk about some of the road that it's taken to get here, and go over some of the most noteworthy pros and cons I think it has in order to try and give you all the most well-rounded and informed perspective that I can. As someone who has not stopped playing the game since it was released in 2019, it's a tall order, one that I'm going to try and accomplish as concisely as I can. So hopefully that all sounds good. Let's get right to it. So a brief overview for those who may not know. The Division 2 is a third person RPG looter shooter where you shoot bad guys, collect shiny loot, make fun loadouts with said loot, and go shoot more bad guys. I'm sure many of you are familiar with the formula. Fortunately, after years of updates and content released, there are a lot of different modes and methods that the game offers you to shoot said bad guys. The Division 2 has a vast open world filled with challenges, secrets, and loot. There's a plethora of dedicated campaign and story missions. You've got more specialized game modes like the summit's 100 floors of randomized layouts and enemy compositions. Descent is a rogike experience baked right into the larger game. There's PvP modes, raid and dungeon-like content. Trust me when I say you'll have more than enough to sink your teeth into. Now, The Division 2 is a live service game through and through, and it's heading into its seventh year of post-launch support. For some people, that might raise an eyebrow or bring up other concerns. Let's address a couple of things here right off the bat. If you're somebody who likes to have a little reassurance in this modern gaming age, you know, with the industry setting records for how quickly games are shut down these days, like the infamous story of Concord, new live service titles seem to come and go every single week. One nice thing about The Division 2 is that it is a proven commodity. It's not the largest looter shooter out there on the market, nor the most successful one. However, it's gone through its growing pains, and it's here to stay for better or worse. Yes, the fan base has a track record of riding the we're so back Wow, the game is dead roller coaster at the slightest nudge in either direction, but objectively, the game has a reliable player base. In fact, it's been steadily rising in the recent months, which has been fun to see. The community, which has its good and bad sides, as all live games do, is unquestionably a very supportive one, with people frequently going out of their way to help newer players in game. There's even a built-in feature for this called shephering. There's online resources like item spreadsheets, groups that jump on weekly to help newer agents through some of the game's tougher content like raids. And then of course there's the development team which while smaller than some of its competitor titles, we'll come back to this, is very committed to keeping the game and its community thriving as best they can. My point is The Division 2 is not a game where you need to worry about a lack of players or the absence of a dedicated community or worst of all having to worry about the game getting cancelled out of nowhere. Realistically, the only thing that is going to kill The Division 2 is The Division 3, but that is still several years away from releasing. Let's circle back to what I mentioned a moment ago about the game's development team. You likely wouldn't know it, but The Division 2 has been on a pretty remarkable journey behind the scenes since its release. I'll give you the shortened version of the story, but essentially the devs who originally made the game were all sent off to go and work on other projects in 2020 after the release of the game's Warlords of New York expansion. Reason being, the original plan was to sunset The Division 2 after its year 2 roadmap. But a few franchise veterans at Massive Entertainment banded together and made a pitch to keep things going. Somehow it got the green light. And so the game then proceeded to go through a 15-month content drought while a new dev team was assembled. New content was made from scratch. And in 2022, much like the franchise's iconic Phoenix symbolism, the game rose from the ashes to begin a new chapter. For most live games, a lapse in updates like that for so long would have killed interest and retention. But The Division community is nothing if not stubborn. This rebuilding of things does mean that the game's team and resources is smaller than other titles you might be familiar with like Destiny or Warframe. On average, the amount of new content they're able to produce per year is less than other competitors. But ironic for the timing of this video, the fact that a new DLC is releasing in less than 2 weeks, more than 5 years after the last large-scale release with Warlords of New York is very telling, I believe, for the passion and commitment that the team has to support the game as best they can. And even though this means that not every new update for the game comes with huge new pieces of content or a new feature, The Division 2 does indeed receive regular seasonal updates, including new storylines, new rare loot to chase, and frequent quality of life improvements. Speaking of content releases and update sizes, let's talk value proposition. As I know for many people, they simply want to know if their money and time investment will yield a satisfactory and memorable gameplay experience. As a brand new player, I believe The Division 2 offers an incredible amount of content. The base game is listed at $30 USD, and one of the major revamps the team implemented in the last year of content was to make it so that regardless of what add-ons and DLC you may own, all Division 2 players are able to progress to the endgame and play alongside everybody else. That's right, all DLC for The Division 2 is completely optional. Owning those things, of course, offers you more content and some exclusive goodies, but you do not need anything other than the base game itself to get the full Division 2 experience. And I think that that is a pretty player forward initiative that the team took. Speaking of which, I know another big question for many is how games in this genre handle their revenue and in-game monetization. Well, it's my view that The Division 2 is about as non-predatory as you can get for a premium live service model like it has. As stated, the game has an upfront cost. DLCs and expansions are paid but optional. But beyond that, all other microtransactions are cosmetic rooted. There's an in-game store with outfits and skins. And then season passes have a paid premium track. These offer additional cosmetics and things like a few extra loot crates, but they hold nothing exclusive in terms of gameplay. All new items that are released each new season are housed on the free portion of the season pass. And furthermore, all of The Division 2's major updates, new game modes, things like that are entirely free and available for all. Of course, this excludes dedicated DLC releases like Battle for Brooklyn that we've got coming up, but I cannot stress how abnormal that is for our game in recent times. Talking about the DLC, Battle for Brooklyn's release on May 27th comes alongside the free year 7 season 1 update, which, as the name implies, is the kickoff for year 7 of the game. The developers have laid out a rough road map on their plans for this year of content, and I figured that recapping that and talking about the state of the game's content overall may prove useful for all of you watching. After the huge package of new content coming with the DLC in season 1, the devs have outlined a combination of core revamps and new features to fill out the rest of their year's plan. For one, they want to strengthen the game's onboarding process, making it a smoother experience for new players to jump in and comprehend all that the game has to offer. They also want to do a pass on the in-game economy and progression, looking at the balance between grind and reward, as well as deepening the options we have for customizing our gear. They want to deepen the variety and offerings of each season, given they're the cornerstone to the game's content model nowadays. And then finally, they talked about introducing a new feature to the game's open world, which would allow it to more dynamically react to your actions within it, potentially increasing the kinds of encounters you'll find and the challenge of it all. So, broadly, that is about what you can expect in terms of updates that The Division 2 puts out in a year's worth of time. That said, I also think it's very important to point out the shortcomings of this current development model. Or if not shortcomings, then really just talk about what the reality of playing a game is these days with a development team that is significantly smaller than the one that originally built it. For one, there is a lot of forgotten content in The Division 2. stuff that served a purpose and had a place at one point in time, but has simply slipped through the cracks in the recent years or just hasn't quite been given the amount of attention that it may deserve. A few examples, PvP is a big one. While we at one time had a dedicated PvP team, they were moved off of the project years ago. This has led to many stagnations of the meta and a lack of regular balancing passes and us receiving no significant content for that side of the game in a long time. There's things like a hardcore mode that has been in beta status for years. There's a game mode known as Kentley College that despite nearly the entirety of the player base unifying and saying that it is boring and outdated, it remains as is, collecting cobwebs. There's also then another part to this where we simply don't get a lot of updates or features that would otherwise seem like no-brainers. At the top of that list, The Division 2 unfortunately does not have crossplay or cross progression. That's a big question I get all the time. There's also a definite lack in frequency of us receiving new locations to visit and explore. Obviously, we do get them with the Brooklyn DLC releasing this month, but the consistency can be few and far between. Now, to be clear, all of what I just laid out is not from a lack of care or passion from the team. It's simply the reality of what happens when a small development team is charged with the gargantuan task of supporting what is meant to be an ever evolving live service looter shooter. And again, The Division 2 is in a unique position of being supported by a team that didn't create and code the base game, an issue that has been cited as one of the roadblocks to us getting things like crossplay. So again, just something that I think is important to be aware of for someone who may be considering getting into The Division 2. But I believe that just about wraps up my thoughts on trying to answer what is really the unanswerable question of if this game is worth it. I could go on all day about gameplay, certain features I like, what I think should be changed. You know, what sorts of controversies are Bob and Timmy raging about on Reddit this week. I'm kidding, of course. Point is, it is a loaded question. And while I'm sure I didn't answer absolutely everything, I hope this video helped pierce the veil and give you somewhat of an idea about The Division 2 in 2025. If after watching this video, you do end up deciding to give The Division 2 a try. I do have an ultimate beginner and returning player guide that I put together a few months ago, a lot of people who have checked that out, you can read the comments on there for yourself, say that it helped them in getting their footing when starting off. So, in case you're interested in that resource, I'll link it in the description below. Additionally, in case you're more interested in this new DLC, Battle for Brooklyn, that I mentioned a few times throughout the video, I've also got a video deep diving into everything you could hope to know on that. I actually got to travel to the development studio recently in order to go hands-on with it. So, again, that'll be linked below if you're interested. That's most of what I've got. I hope the video helped out. If it did and you want to stay in the loop with all things Division 2 moving forward, I'll have a ton of content coming out over these next few weeks for the DLC's release, then I hope you'll consider subscribing. We'd love to have you around. That's it for me though. I look forward to hopefully seeing some of you agents out there in the field. But until then, thank you so much for watching. Rogue Gold out. [Music]"}, {"source": "YouTube: THE DIVISION 2 Walkthrough Gameplay Part 1 - INTRO (PS4 Pro)", "content": " alright guys welcome to the division 2 I am beyond excited I didn't play too much at the beta I did a few of the videos and then some of the in-game content but I knew that nothing was gonna get carried over so I didn't want to like dump too much time cuz I went I went pretty hard in the first game I like I went I think I put over 50 days of play time I know some of that might have just been standing there but overall that is a lot of time so and you know like she drop on this I'm hoping we can hit twenty or thirty thousand I did get two extra digital codes for these games are for this game one Xbox one one for ps4 if you want a chance to win see the like the video or leave the comment of when you found this youtube channel so I love you guys best audience ever if we have like 20 or 30,000 likes definitely expect a couple of parts each day I don't know if it has a full fledged story or what but we're gonna kind of find out together so I love you guys let's get this alright nice so we just at the very beginning you just get to let me randomize a few times I'm curious I can't want to make it look like the guy that I had in the first one on you to toggle the body type hold on I was really mad I think you just start with a random pearl I start with this and then I just customized everything oh I'm not gonna go too far into I guess detail I don't know I mean I guess that's fine like I'm not gonna spend too much time on it like the eyebrow height I'm gonna leave everything like it is now what is this I'll the eye color I'll change that at least I guess I'll do oh yeah so some of these colors are a little different maybe for you versus me I I don't I think this is red it could be orange I really don't know I'm semi I think I'm colorblind like reds and oranges I don't know what it is about it so I wore a beanie in the first game a lot since this actually all matters now I guess all that actually looks kind of cool will slicked back here let's go with that no facial hair I got to do a little bit of scruff right where's it at no look what the Elvis Presley exe you know what it reminds me of the the preacher guy from true detective the first season the guy that was on stage talking everybody cuz they're not just like a like a minimum like that's that's a little much I feel like I'm just gonna not have facial hair markings we gotta go with some kind of scar we got the kazuya oh that looks sick what is this nice I'm gonna go with this one I like that name him scar man yo the customization is really well done in this game here's the thing you're not gonna see your character a lot anyways I wouldn't imagine so none of this really is gonna truly affect anything plus I'm probably gonna wind up if I really enjoy this game I'm gonna wind up having a bunch of different characters thinking have up to four I played the first game I hate to say it but I played the first game for probably over i'ma go with that I would say almost around 50 days of play time maybe more all it's actual tattoo nice it's not it really a lot is there what is that looks badass mmm that looks kind of wicked doesn't it what is this one oh this one's like front and center I like that yo that actually looks badass what's that you can't really see it actually I think I like that one let's go without the customization is really well done oh that's sick you know they did they did a great job shion's he'll let me rotate all that's sick yeah they did a really good job with this I don't know get too carried away because I could be here for hours I might get one of the ones that kind of cover up the arm though I does look pretty cool it's going that one or hold on I didn't see these I like this one all right we're good no tattoo needed down there from good outfit now here's the thing I rocked a beanie old that there it was I think is that it hold on what's one is this when we rotate him back around I think it was something like this I hadn't yeah I think it's this one definitely when it covered up the years although these kind of go out a little further cuz I guess here's these are different well we got I'm not gonna rock this that's some that's just weird there's gonna be a lot of outfits you unlock in the game anyways I would imagine let's go with actually the main this one's fine fine with that I definitely want long pants though I had all this stuff in the first game oh there we go there we go shoes it's got to be some kind of boots for this type of game there we go all right I'm good patch that's the only patch I have does nothing carry over from the first game here we go well it'll create a character there all the game just begins Wow Oh oh look at this this whooping in the beta be me the game proceed to the marker yo this game is sick already guys I cannot wait there's so much going on right now wait what's over there why just all the sudden have a gun vibration a playoff ps4 right now I was gonna play on PC but I thought maybe since I spent all that time on ps4 maybe some of it carry over I never use this in the first game so flight wait how do you slifer's have like no help once there we go am i so you start off the game just getting XP you got to protect the agents I'm gonna follow him oh really a Canadian guy I don't see the lightning bolt yet or whatever it is so no shotgunners really I think it was so I'm gonna check the perimeter see to those barricades have someone really betray the other look out for stragglers some of those bastards got away I didn't expect into their attack so soon yeah okay if this keeps up we're gonna have to relocate come on help me with this we're stretched too thin to protect everyone here that can't be right this is a distress code the coordinates for Washington DC how is this possible someone has to say we can't just leave whatever happened it needs to be fixed or it's all over Google I'll do what I can here go we took things for granted we expected coffee in the morning we expected free Wi-Fi when those were taken from us we survived when communications broke down the trains stopped and the internet went dark we survived but when the pharmacies were looted and hospitals shut down asthma became lethal and with no police to protect you did you own a gun did your neighbor some survived we are a resilient species when our society collapsed we found ways to go on and now for the first time in centuries what we want is also truly what we need in the face of disaster we helped each other we built new communities and the ruins of the old we adapted we survived established a new normal but there are also those who build nothing create nothing hyenas preying on the weak they've made our world bleed but we don't stand alone a brave few have sworn to protect us and save what remains may unite us remind us that we are one people they are our shield and their light but if that light goes out who can save us then it's been seven months since the outbreak we still live in fear of the virus the green poison the real danger is out there waiting incoming alert on the shd emergency channel flash priority the base of operations is under attack hostile forces have breached our southern perimeter we are in need of immediate assistance repeat need immediate assistance from any nearby agents this one the start of the beta was darker like I know we kind of go up to the White House lawn and it's like all is it like at nighttime it almost felt like or maybe just took me forever but there'll be a lot of similar between this and the beta but now there's gonna be a lot of stuff unlocked but once I get to a certain point it'll be all new stuff so thanks ringing I'll support you drop on this are they kicked this guy I think can you save that guy's dead anyways I believe oh yeah they were just kicking a dead body never mind you know the atmosphere in this game is amazing I was worried about the daytime but the final version of this game so far looks amazing I don't think I need to restock yeah 100 100 a our bullets I'll take it yeah this is just like the start of the beta now here we go I don't know if they can see you when you do this well this is a tactical take a grenade guns not the most accurate concussion agent if you can hear us on this frequency keep pushing forward and blindside these bastards we'll see what this was neat kneepads okay none of this really matters until you get to the I'm guessing level 30 is the max wonder why it's always 30 an anthem I was 30 in this game it was 30 I think or is gonna be 30 destiny it's like 20 then they bump it to 40 I don't know it's always like this smaller then then wants the actual gear score stuff kicks in it appeal exit all like matters at that point fills we're not having abilities or anything I got healing but that's it I can't wait to finally hit endgame the endgame grind for this game is what's gonna make her break it for me story was always pretty good the first one I will say this massive really impressed me with the first game I remember how the first game was kind of in a bad state and then I think it got so bad they like they even came on their stream and says I hate ya you know we know the games bad right now for a company to be able to say that and then make it justice to swear i XE got back into it so I took a leg up I would say almost like a 10 month of break or so after like 1.45 I believe stop playing it I think came back to it the game was better than it whatever was it was so good behind me so yeah I have a I have high hopes esteem eight-person raids are gonna have it's gonna be all kinds of stuff so like you can probably just run to this area but I want the XP right now you guys watch those had two clips on YouTube one that was one be live I believe in the dark zone that the one v6 were like my highlight moments I love that stuff nice alright we're good I went to bed yeah I remember it being darker I don't know it's like small differences here in there now you're gonna kill me uh no we're good hey we made the new base of operations [Music] thanks for the help out there you should check in with Manny our coordinators upstairs in the Blue Room and come by here if you ever need help with your tick Arbor is a little better I'm gonna deconstruct that wall Don selling prices not me yeah I'm Steve constructed crafting was king in the first game for like the first update and then after the hold almost progression say let me cure iya says it have like the amount of main missions that are in the game and stuff comms database let's check all this out oh wait is some of this from the beta hold on oh no oh okay never mind it's just stuff we know anything I was in the first game I can't I can't remember honestly you have items in your mailbox visit the stash hold on I wish is that the stash I didn't see anything what's here uh deliveries grants what is all this oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] let's go hold on move the inventory what is all this is this like the if your mailbox is full okay all nice just like the postmaster okay I wonder if I can change up like my emblem and stuff let me check that role I'm just I'm just really curious right now I guess it'd be under character right so this is like showing your overall credit chance credit damage it's not a nice menu what is this oh nice here I can change some stuff yeah check it out I guess I'll put that on since it says a superior but I don't know how its superior now I guess I'll look like everyone else the scarf I don't like to color the shirt though it's the only thing I guess I'll put that there it does really matter and then boots cool art we're good I'm guessing apparel is the same thing yeah okay we're good nice nice I don't know if that's like the early access stuff Ubisoft gave me the code actually gave me more than one codes which is love doing like a small giveaway on this video this is you welcome to DC I'm Annie I run comps I'm guessing the division alert brought you here damn glad to see you let me show you exactly how screwed we are ever since the JTF imploded the city's become a playground for murderous [\u00a0__\u00a0] there are several main factions and a whole lot of bottom feeders sucking up whatever the big dogs miss a few civilian settlements are still holding out against all this villainy they need more help than we've been able to provide especially since the division network went dark um that's Kelso she's one of the last surviving agents in DC she's operating under the theater settlement on a priority mission you should go check in with her if anyone knows how to get these systems back online it's her oh and introduce yourself to the locals while you're at it it'll come for them to know there's a new sheriff in town by the way agent head downstairs some chicken with a quartermaster he can get you set up with such division taxes you're gonna need the edge it's a skill unlocked it's available at the quartermaster I leveled up nice oh so I gotta go visit him anyways I think is this oh here's where it is right here yeah you have to get skills through this thing now here's the thing in the beta there was only four things that you could pick unlocking skills choose pulse variant do I have to do can I pick other things let me see if I can pick something else I used to drone what is what is this thing yo check it out Firefly hive all that looks nasty different types oh you can have a shield which I think is the route I really want to go cuz I loved the shield stuff in the other games like it was so good but I kind of want to try out this thing let me see what it does in the video okay you mark three different people now what oh it just blinds them it doesn't really even I don't know the turret was really good let me see what oh yeah I'm definitely getting this I have to I'm definitely yeah RN tutorial these are perks these are things you're just gonna get passively over the yeah passive bonuses acquired by shd tech perks can be unlocked none of this was already like all this stuff is already unlocked in the beta so you didn't have any way to experience this so we have to unlock this one it wanted me to unlock the pulse but since I have a choice I figured why not go for the other one Oh strongholds okay I don't think that was in there I think so I think there might have been one actually there's activity benefits and upgrades in the world so we're just gonna select that I mean look at the level stuff around me 15 18 um I'm level 2 yeah we got a stick in this area so alright the theater we're going I think I can I go out this way let me look at the monument I think I get something when I ya discover it essentially one thing I do want to chambers you'll be going through are hyena territory they're a bunch of vicious [\u00a0__\u00a0] who prey on the weak and vulnerable and kill for kicks and they destroy whatever they can't steal for themselves and they've been an especially serious problem for the theater settlement give in a situation if we need the help of the settlements but they can't do much if they're struggling to survive so see what you can do to take some pressure off them but don't forget that we have to get the shade Network back to full strength and a lot of places the division has been the only thing holding people together but when DC is the priority most agents are completely cut off they're not gonna last long without support all right here we go equip that deconstruct this oh I'm gonna turn that off really quick that's something that was a big thing and the other one I think we're good incoming Paul yeah and I can make Paul my talk about incoming call let me turn that off really quick and then I'll continue I think you can go out this way yeah it opens up alright nice now which way do we go to get to that well let me let me check someone's I'm serious hold on no assets disabled on call here we go you're climbing back up request what I think we're good yeah I'm trying to get through the story right now why don't we be helping people later on we will though all right it's look at the map really quick so we're trying to get to this area over here let me see if I can actually yeah I have to go back okay so I have to go through this side of the camp all right yeah this game I will tell you it is a probably gonna be a long grind to get to the end but what I'll most likely do this to be one of those games that I kind of played like Resident Evil 2 back in January I beat it then I just kind of make videos for here and there how are there already fighting thing is you got a pistol you're good I don't have the d3 built like I'm used to but maybe this shields still good I love this med you get like a SMG and the other one you could use it with the d3 bill or this guy go he can't do anything can you still hit him with it where did that guy go he'd run off I see the little icon oh there he is that bastard there you go nice staying in cover I don't think so can you just pull it back up I guess if you don't really burn through it you can just infinite number of uses I love this men this is a game I've been waiting for guys I was worried about the character being a little bit floaty like I'm moving left to right stuff like that like when you stop moving they stop it's just like the first game now I think I've heard when the early people got the play tested when the early people got the play tested it was like people are talking about that I actually have two guns I could put on my I'm just gonna keep the one on for now I only think it matters I mean doesn't let me double check I just put it on anyways level two aka use the same kind of bullets I'll go with the little submachine gun gun I never use in the first game because it was pretty much bad it's kind of like the - I don't know if this game has named weapons like the exotic stuff the first game did like big-time but a lot of stuff that was good about the first game wasn't really in the game until like later on like they took a lot of time to really get that game to the state it was so I'm glad to see a lot of this stuff like the accomodations all that stuff everything they put into the first game is here granted your progress isn't here were you at whatever recharging I don't know what it is it's like at that little pulse thing going with it green gas get the hell out of there probably gonna see me jump levels between videos cuz I will be playing this a lot without actually capturing but when I record the main missions that's kind of what that's kind of how this series is gonna go now that's the thing some of this stuff was in the beta summative of it wasn't I was just gonna jump to where I was in the beta but you're kind of thrown into the game I feel like midway through as far as like your level and stuff and you're very limited on all the stuff you can do now that I can play it like how I actually want to it's actually kind of cool how like it isn't like I wasn't able to use this in in that so you got Luke wise some gloves I don't think I have any gloves that are decent no red though hold on what is all the guy what is this echo reconstructed oh my god that goes back with some National Guard buddies there were that get called out the quarantine in New York tonight he'll be with some National Guard buddies there were that get called to help with the quarantine in New York okay this is serious you remember swine flu everyone freaked out for nothing you'll see in a couple of months no one will even remember what the thought of who was like y2k y2k you really know how to make it I feel old I'm just messing with you but I don't know this doesn't feel like it's just gonna blow over people are scared and you know what happens when people in scary way too much meal give me your wallet yeah don't make us lose you Elmo oh you should just give it up old man please stay with Nikhil so the dollar flew I should get xp for that right I don't think I do I might skip the echoes if I don't get any XP unless - like in an actual mission that was the same one from the main event is named SS or try to stay on a good side nice I love how you discover stuff in this game like it pans up like that alright Odessa safe haven this is where you start getting people to kind of join you and stuff I hope I can get the SWAT armor the shield definitely is powerful I felt like the other thing that repairs like your armor is nice but I don't know I'd rather just have armor like whenever I wanted you know call off the show I can control it I can just be standing around too [Music] I just want you guys know how happy I am playing this game right now I got the biggest smile on my face like it all matters now that's the biggest thing for me is when you play a beta for a game I'm like alright I enjoy it but I don't want to like ruin the the experience by getting too much into it you know oh here we go we're crafting table there if you're looking for agent Kelso she just left I should have gone with her but I'd only slow her down I know you got your own problems to deal with them hyena [\u00a0__\u00a0] took my little girl get to me if you can help I'll be on your debt and I always pay my debts all right see what we got I think this is the same one preparations while I wait for the new aging to arrive what kind of preparations the usual kind remember the point is to rescue a hostage and not bring down the building they can just do matchmaking I think my voice just cracked not even [\u00a0__\u00a0] you guys yeah I don't think I accept to go there I think I can just match make and then I don't know if it teleports me or not actually you know what the hell with that I want to do a mile and the missions are easy when you're by yourself anyways I'm not going to the whole game like that but I'm just into thinking I'm like you know what what's the point of me there's anything else in here why don't see if I can have an actual symbol next to my name so you have a clan that's actually kind of cool progression main missions really add to log just so much stuff in this game free mess of regular updates oh yeah they're gonna be adding a lot of stuff in this game apparently all right we got new service get the vendor deploy main oh yeah is that rope at let's talk to this guy first here we got here I'm not gonna buy anything right now but I will start selling stuff in bulk you can just mark it and sell it later on that's actually a cool thing at this game used to not having the first one and then they added eventually so I don't with a rope is who's gonna keep it going though nice yeah I think I would have had to have I don't think I can fast travel to a main mission unless I'm already kind of been to that area at least that's why I think that's why they gets a little vehicle to go up like that and Ralph's to gather water here we go no Book of Eli yeah what that movie should have been called the quest for water I did such a great job with this game I feel like the environments hey buddy if it doesn't remind you of I am Legend I don't know what does I think that's uh sundeck Oh hold on oh no it's this thing nice XP right next to the Grand Washington hotel okay head to the service entrance on the east side of the building submachine gun I got I know that I could use it with the d3 bills kind of the whole point of it you can all use testing normally but I'm gonna get a pistol with like a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton a credit damage and just go and on people into thing yeah see okay see the shield going up I didn't I just now noticed that you see the bar going up down the like in the middle right there so eight gradually retire I guess the only time you have to really get rid of it is when it breaks down completely yes is the same mission from the beta it's all good though people always forget - this games an RPG before like when we see like the bosses later on oh yeah I'm about to farm in this game you best believe guys thanks here no hyena big shot real unpleasant we need to kill this [\u00a0__\u00a0] this game seems very well balanced and thought-out the menu is super fast I don't know if you guys remember how slow it was to open the original missions skeletal difficulty I think if you have one person it's just a lot easier than if you have to but if you have like four and the enemies are just become bullet sponges but then again you have more people getting you XP which is also a nice thing you get behind them I did this mission a few times and often I looked he's gonna run go ahead and spot me they don't see me yet sneaking through the bushes now you can just shoot them and open I can please transfer the way my character looks this thing lasts forever I can see it kind of being if you gotta use it like it's recharges really fast I don't know maybe it's just me but it just feels like it has so far me you just have to be faced let's check our stuff really quick to see little extra armor gloves I'll mark that for junk as well the mask I thought I would need but it'll mark that as well I'm gonna sell everything instead of deconstructing I feel like crafting will only get you so far if they did what they did in the first game it was effective for a little while but eventually you just wanted to buy stuff of Phoenix credits and then like normal credit from the vendors and stuff let's go they sold a few games I feel like I can honestly say I know what I'm doing like all the way from down from the abilities to what works what guns are good this out the box I know like a lot of stuff about it type submit' and the ones that charge you like that one just did a minute ago this guns really nice we grabbed this there's anything around here alrights get some ammo really quick you think about pistols is our infinite ammo doesn't even matter does it I will be playing with other people that type in enemy with the lightning bolt worm that really is is essentially a shotgun er someone who's gonna melee you to death I'll just go ahead and get shot a few times to equip that why can't I equip it that's weird maybe cuz I'm in combat I don't know now in the other game you could actually just start running what's the help with that you see the stomp was like explosive I don't know if that was just like a fine mistake or what right nice easy XP of kelp think about these games it's just like anthem destiny where you're gonna replay a lot of the same levels over and over to get like a builds you really like and then I'm telling you I've waited for this game ever since they announced it I was nervous excited all that all the above basically all right now let me try to equip off kind of strange I wasn't able to there we go what in the world is that like is that like you can't equip stuff in combat Kanade kind of odd oh yeah forget about this but take my time with the first video for every series I've done this year has been almost an hour so this one might be about really don't know yep as long as I'm not breathing that blast did a lot of damage I was gonna play this on PC but like I said earlier if anything had gotten carried over I wanted it to like count all my stuff it might still maybe just haven't got to a certain point yet I'm excited though man this game is uh finally here fun fact about this video that I'm making right now I actually drove home I wouldn't saw like my mom and stuff today took her out to eat and everything just got to spend time with her this past couple days since I got home I installed this I started playing it I was like kids often come back to like a clean slate you know just to finish Devil May Cry it's just it's a good feeling plus this game is awesome already like I'm already kind of silly 60-plus now that everything matters ice thing about anthem like I played it I beat the story and I haven't really played it I don't like Morris the game that's gonna have a big time in game I know from back this one's gonna bring think up bad one there though this guy go just song they'd run from me really dude half Oh Mike the damage that is nice I could be healing up my other armor but I feel like I don't necessarily because once I get past this area and all the enemies are gone you get that armor back anyway stayed I feel like with this unit you don't it's likely that it just goes right back you save everything by doing this is all weapon right here or this looks like a division texting oh we can it's gonna quip that and on top of that mark the other one for junk so I can sell that down down the road I like when you level up in this game now that they thought it all the way out to get the filled proficiency cache they just did such a great job overall the game is very polished you know that sound effect was nice shot that an instant rent you don't really need as much ammo just pull out the shield and use the pistol it gets the job done yeah you keep like everything maxed I love it oh that's not a grenade this a confuse Oh concussion grenade I guess is what it was called you can't do anything until it goes away that's very effective gonna be nasty in the dark zone for sure I didn't get a chance to do any dark some stuff in the in the early like the footage I got none of that had it they said like one area and then I got to unlock the darks on in the beta that was about it so this first video is gonna be kinda long we're at the end of the dough or anything like the first full-fledged main mission all right there chilling there I'm gonna go over here no need to play it quiet enemies are so weak when you're by yourself I will play with other people later on but I think hey as long as I can play the story solos for a little bit maybe get some mxp get leveled up on my own I mean what's the hurt there you know it's gonna be a public lunch per minute that'll do pistol anyway - we kind of purchased at the door farm guys named it amis all right get in there get off me to be tied to weird take a good nice easy-peasy man that was so nice I just like cleared that mission so much quicker than I did in the beta so much quicker Eleanor your mom said just to bring you home are you hurt who who are you what's going on she's in shock I'll bring her down when she's fit to move let's meet at the theater later all right return to the atrium get down there and take care of them I got Eleanor good thing about this build I'm guess I'm going for right now with the are not the bill but the skill I'm using is it just like huh you don't use a lot of bullets you know I'd say use that in the pulse to get higher crit chance maybe oh yeah forget about this really the gun oh my god maybe 25 prayer let's go the urge to watch Breaking Bad right Aloha maybe's the guest masters yell I'm all like [\u00a0__\u00a0] over here let me just go ahead and I should have put on that armor I just got I can shoot the pouch right I think the pouch yeah that was it nice your health goes up too I forget about that all right we can go back to the base of operations or we can go back here one thing I will do I'm gonna export my footage I've been recording for like an hour and [Music] save going on here shot at them they did oh we're good no it's super dark right here too let's go meet with her and then I think before we go talk to her I'm gonna I'll be able to splice the footage together with editing but I just hate to lose like I've had sometimes I'll record and I'll just lose all my footage it's it really sucks all right give me once I'm getting paranoid some guys go ahead and mark some of these for junk get everything kind of section down here what we got here going to equip that mark that for junk this thing which ones that's worse all right I'm looking strictly an armor right now because that's really the only thing that matters in the early on game I feel like that one's lower because you could oh yeah the fill proficiency caches I was gonna save them but the problem with that is the fact that you have to open them early on otherwise I'm not gonna be as effective because they are scaled to your actual level oh that's a nice one let me put that on what is this I guess I'll just mark that one I'll keep those two since are both uncommon I just can't get rid of the pistols so those are good everything should be good what just happened oh I think I went to the thing let me go here talk to her and then pretty sure Artie got this know what's oh maybe it canceled the first time I did it are we good been playing for over an hour now that's all on the videos after editing probably uh be something around there maybe less I'll probably talk to her and then I may go unlock my second skill I'm gonna use the pulse most likely oh I just realized this what if you use are you gonna go talk to everybody now there's all this stuff right here deploy main rappel rope secondary rappel rope the barbeque let's go talk to everyone really quick it's on the map sea salvage blueprints vertical

"YouTube: DLC: BATTLE FOR BROOKLYN Day 1 Gameplay!", "content": " [Music] All right. Hello everybody. It is launch day. Can we freaking believe it? It is the launch day of the DLC. What is up, Richard? Spamming the hype emote in the chat. Indeed, Postman, Helio, Satanta, Victor, Wilson, I'm scrolling through the chat. Everybody here, what is going on? Okay. Sorry, I'm just wrapping a few things up. Uh, should be good there. I turn that off. Okay. Is my mic good? I'm just trying to get everything set. Thank you so much for being here. Uh, today is going to be a big stream, likely a pretty long stream. We're going to be diving into the DLC. I'm just getting everything set up right now. I'm actually going to close Discord altogether. We don't need that going on. 250 people in the stream already. Welcome everybody. Thank you so much for being here. If you want to help out, be sure to hit the like button. We are going to be live for a long time today. So, let's freaking get it. Postman. Good lord, dude. Starting things off with insanity with a 50 gifted memberships. Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] dude. Thank you so much. Goodness gracious, man. All right, today's stream is going to run a little bit differently. I know normally I shout every single gifted out and we do all that stuff. I imagine there's going to be just a lot going on today. We're going to try and just immerse in the DLC as much as possible. So, I'm not going to read all 50 people. I also want to try and save my voice as much as possible. Um, but thank you so much, dude. That is incredibly generous. 50 people just gifted a membership by Postman. If that was you and you're here, please give them a thank you. That is incredibly nice. Um, so yeah, I got my failout outfit because we have to. Um, I got a bunch of cashes, but I don't think I'm going to bother going through it too much. Again, there's just so much going on all at once here. Um, Satanta, don't curse me with that, please. Uh, by the way, Gugayas, I think I haven't known how to say your name before. I apologize, but thank you for becoming a member of Rogue Studios. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Again, Postman, thank you for the 50, dude. It is still rolling in. We are going to get straight to the DLC, everybody. We already have 300 people in here. Um, again, I just wanted to lock everything up. This is the build I'm rocking in with. We've got our new modifiers turned on. Uh, yes, let's put that on. You have to hold the button now. Okay. All right. So, we got the new modifier for hardcore on activation. Freeze all attributes. Okay, I don't really care. We'll figure it out. So, we're going to get our XP bonus from that. We got the new season. We got projects. There's a game pass project. This is going to be a huge update. I already got all these. We'll do that later. I'm not going to worry about that right now. Can I just quickly pop some of these cashes? Make some room. Guys, this is such an exciting day. It's been five years since we had a new DLC to dive into. I cannot freaking wait. People asking, \"Where did I get the onestrap backpack?\" This one is available in the store. This is the fa outfit. Agent, we need you back in New York. Oh, I know you need this in New York. Shall we do it, chat? Should I go to Brooklyn? Is it time? Is it time to go to Brooklyn? If you guys rather I just hang around the White House, I can do that. You know, maybe that would be more fun. Okay, just kidding. Everyone's saying yes. Let's go. Good to see you. Experience a storydriven adventure in the iconic Brooklyn. The fate of Brooklyn is at risk as the cleaners are set to return. Transfer to Brooklyn. Okay, here we freaking go. Let's do it again, Postman. Thank you so much, dude. That is incredibly kind of you everybody. Thank you for being here. How many people we got? Already pushing 450. Welcome, welcome, welcome folks. Cut scene. Agent, thank you for coming. We need to recover. I'll send the coordinates for a helipad near her last known location. Look at that shot. Oh man. Uh, two things to shout out by the way. The there is a link at the I have a pinned comment at the top of the chat. I was given a code for a Battle for Brooklyn cash which you can redeem. It gets you two exotic caches and some materials if you'd like to redeem that. The code and the link are in that thing at the top of the chat. Candle and her details. cleaners have candle. Let's get it. Um, also for anyone who did not watch some of my videos or do not know, agent, I need to debrief with Schaefer. We're getting seasons there. We're in Brooklyn. We got fog of war on. We freaking made it, people. We've been waiting two years. Two years since this was announced and we are now standing in Brooklyn. How so real is that? The music. Good lord. Only other thing I wanted to say is that if you didn't catch my prior coverage, I have played the first third of the DLC when I got to visit Massive last month. So, some of this stuff I'm already familiar with. We're going to, you know, go through and look at it all, of course, but just to give you that context. Um, let's get it, people. Here we go. We can't afford to lose. Oh, is this the Osprey from Div 1? Is that what everyone's saying? That's a great detail cuz we got picked up like right here already hidden with the nostalgia. We got the purple flame flying out. We got our modifiers. My god, dude. Two years and we're finally here. How crazy. Ally detected. Ally detected. Anna is our AI this this DLC. Ally in need of assistance. Let's go save Candle. Um, by the way everybody, compared to a normal stream, this is going to I can hear them shooting here. There will be a lot less chat interaction this stream compared to normal. Uh, obviously there's a lot for me to pay attention to with everything going on here. And I think as I said a moment ago, I want to try and save my voice as much as possible cuz there are going to be a lot of videos to record. So if you have questions, uh, obviously feel free to send them if I see any. I will do my best to answer. But largely, I'm just going to be playing and you all can follow along in the journey. All right, purple flame. I actually probably should have read that. Hang on. Can we uh purple flame? Purple flame. Purple flame. Uh, it's a new unique type of fire that deals burn damage after initial burn. Max armor degradates steadily, capping at 30%. You can stop the burn by using armor kits. Each armor kit removes 50% of the damage. Okay. or by leaving combat and then it's removed gradually. Hazard protection on gear will reduce the duration of the purple flame damage. So hazard does have an effect, but I guess he won't be completely immune. Flame detected. This is so wild that we're here. All new maps, all new play spaces. People are asking what is my uh build? I'm using ongoing directive with momento in the blue screen. Uh, can you buy the DLC with in-game currency? No, you have to use real real duckets, real money. [Music] Come on. We need to get to the armory. Come out of the sewer. They're on the street. You need to catch up with them. We got Hoskins talking to us, too, from Hearts on Fire. She's finally in game. I just wanted to look over here. 650 people watching this stream. Thank you all so much for being here. It's Battle for Brooklyn launch day. All right. Oh, you guys ready for this? This shot right here is beautiful. When you step out of here, are you ready? Ah, the classic spot. We're in Brooklyn, baby. Yeah, Chris, that is exactly my sentiment. I There's no way I could keep up. Hoskins, come in. Hoskins. Hoskins, come in. Locked in the armory. What's left of the crew is trying to stop the cleaners, but it's only a matter of time. Help is on the way. Hold tight. cleaners feel it as satisfying to fight as they always do. I'll be excited to set my world difficulty up so we're not like one-shotting these guys. As long as she has someone to protect her. All right, you all ready for this next beat? Again, I played this part of the DLC. That's why I know what's coming up here. But we're going to get to go to a familiar location here. Agent, I still can't reach out this spot. Anyone remember? And then we go down here. It's the mother police station. Good. From the E3 2013 trailer out. They got the sign up there. I'm trying to figure out. Oh, I max out in every category on my seasonal mods. That's pretty tight. Classic hiding behind a sign as all good division enemies do. They're gone. My security detail is gone. All right, we get to go in the Exactly. Richard, we should go down there later. We get to go in the police station. Agent, you need to get inside now. located the helipad and the docks for his operation. Go secure on. And here's Candle. We haven't seen her since division one. Oh, wait. Can I not open it? Oh, shoot. I already forgot. Oh, there we go. Thank you, Anna. Candle me in the armory. She's dead, isn't she? Damn it. Thank you for coming, Agent. All right, that's better. I readjusted my mic a little bit. It was too much in my screen. Uh, by the way, folks, 800 people in here watching, thank you for being here. If you've not already and you want to help out, I would appreciate you hitting the like button. It helps the share in the algorithm and all that. and we are going to be live for probably quite a long time today. This is likely going to be the longest stream I've ever done on the channel. So, strap in. Hey, we got Buzz Lightbear in the chat. What's up, man? Very good to see you, sir. Happy launch day. I'm surprised you're not doing your own live thing. I saw that you got sponsored to come back and review it. That's awesome, man. All right, this is that same lane that we did in the original Brooklyn mission. We went down that way to the garage. Now I'm going back here. Hostiles incoming. Oh, they're spawning behind us. playing and recording starts in about 30 30 minutes for me. Gotcha. Well, thanks for stopping by, man. I've been keep keeping up with your uh Hell Diver stuff lately. Looks like they got some good updates on there. I'm just so glad we get something like this for Div. It's been so long, dude. As you know, detected. How fun. All right, let me pop my link. So, I just doubled all my attributes, I guess. I still need to really figure out how the seasonal mod works. And by the way, if anyone's wondering why this looks so easy, it's because we're on the little intro mission still, so we haven't set our difficulty. Thank you, Agent. Escort Jess back to the bridge. I'll update your security clearance so the guards don't think you're hostile. All right, we got to take the bridge. Uh, do I go back through here? I swear I played this a month ago. Totally. Ah, yes. [Music] Cut scene number two. Agent, you made it. We get to go to the bridge. Thank you for getting Jess back for us. Cleaners attacked a settlement in Long Island a couple weeks ago, but this is their first time in Brooklyn. A couple weeks ago. That's Paradise Lost was a couple weeks ago. Need to prioritize the threats. I'll let you know when we get a lead with Theo and DC. So, that's good to contextualize cuz Theo is the one who set up this settlement. We heard about that in the coms. There we go. The bridge. By the way, thank you all so much for the likes and for being here. Over 800 people is crazy. New settlement, baby. Discovered Dumbo. Let's talk to Hoskins. First time in game. Thank you for getting Jess back. I really don't think we would have made it this far if we didn't have Candle keeping us healthy. Okay. Logistics and lodging. Truth. We're running short on beds, but I'll find somewhere you can hang your hat. Welcome to the bridge. Look forward to working with you, agent. Sweet. Got candle in here. How wild is it that we have candle back after all this time? You ever get tired of rescuing the same people over and over again? You know, I thought I was going to be the hero. Save the world destroyed by science with science. I keep ending up your damsel in distress. I uh I guess we do what we're best at. Anyways, if you need anything, we've got a decent medical staff now. We're no hospital, but we've got vaccines, and we're a step beyond. Alli distress call detected. Allied distress call. They're burning everything. Please, agent, you have to hurry. Discover main mission. All right. So, this is the first side mission that we have over here. Um, I think we got a Oh, we got our first collectible. Electronic device. Where's Sarah? She's gone. I can see that. Where did she go? She's with Mark. Mark's dead. Yeah. What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] happened? She couldn't live without them. Walked into the Hudson. [\u00a0__\u00a0] It's recorded on the security cameras at the pier. We still haven't recovered her body. [\u00a0__\u00a0] Um, people are talking about long load times. I'm afraid I I don't know. I can't help you at this point. I do not know the current status. Hey there. Got all these. No smart cover yet. Um what I'm curious is, do you all think we could find the field? You think we can find the wall for the hunter masks? Assuming there is one not an wound clean if we're operating next to a literal pile of chicken for the garden. Where would they be? I get your point. This is not supposed to be where we Well, the settlement might upgrade as we go through. I suppose. I didn't really think about that. Bounty specialization seasons. And if it gets stabiliz that's actually kind of handy to put the spec right there. I know at the castle it's like way out of the way the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Is there a part of this where you can see other players like in boney need to lay low and not draw too much. I assume this is a way out. That's cool. Yeah, that's a gate. Check the map for a key icon in the bridge. I can't zoom in any more than that. I don't see any key icon. It's There's a chance that it pops up later or there's not one. I was just curious. I'll look up here. We'll get on. We'll we'll keep doing the things right after this. I was just just wanted to peep. What's up here? I want to go. Oh, we got the barber up here. That's good. All right. Well, we'll find it later. Um, here. Give me one second here. All right, I'm gonna have someone join in a few, but let's uh So, we have our first side mission here. I think what I what we have to do first though is go and find some of the original Division One spots, right? I'm the only one that's made it this far. I doubt that. I'm sure we got There's people doing stuff, right? Out in the open world, man. All right, so we're set to heroic. That's good. Uh 5% of fog of war revealed. Hardwired is the target loot. location guarded by armed hostiles. This is [Music] crazy. All right. Sorry, I was just doing that while I was on my other screen. Um, we have to go and look at the at the spots, people. So, this is where we came up out of for that tutorial thing. That's cool that you can actually go back down there. Normally, I feel like they would cover that back up. Uh, but if we keep going down here, this is the spot, people. This is the spot. This was the car that we customize our character out of in Division One right here. Hostile control point detected. Oh, there's a control point up here. Oh, well, we might have to do that. And then we shot the bottles that were on this this thing. Remember, it's been like what I think 10 months in game since we were here. in the world. So, a good amount has changed. Oh, yep. There's one of the new This is a control point. I was going to go over to the apartment, but we can or the, you know, the safe room. We can take this on. This is one of the new defenses that they have where it's just going to lob nades at us. What is this called? the warehouse. Okay, those things are no joke. Oh, DLC actually keeping the content difficult. I respect it. I like it. Reinforcements incoming. Oh, I can go in here. Yeah, those defenses are no joke. This is the part that I got to do the least in my preview was walk around and explore the open world. Hear more coming out below me. Hostile detected. Too bad. The blue screen is just like the best thing ever. Oh, and a resource convoy coming in. Classic. Oh, shoot. Oh, shoot. It's one of the turrets. Assistance needed. I'm telling you, dude, those things are not a joke. So, the other one was like an automatic nade launcher. This one is just the straight up flamethrower. Oh no, it does both. Good lord. Good lord. I get it, dude. You're real terrifying. Okay, I need to follow the wire to actually disable the box. Let's see if I can climb up here. Although, there are shock panels. Sometimes I ran into that in the preview. Okay, I just got to go fast. The wire's inside. There it is. Got to get off the fire. Please. Does this one have its own? It does, which is going to be here. All right, we should be more safe from those now. Uh detecting additional hostile contacts. Found the mortars for the final measure gear set. Well, that's going to be really good in PvP because I think it counts for the mortar turret, which is very lethal in PvP. So, I'm excited for that. Um, by the way, folks, we have over a thousand people in the stream again. Thank you so much for being here. How many, if anyone can check, how many people are watching The Division 2 on Twitch right now? I'm curious how I think it was like 13,000 when I looked earlier in the day. Only 8k. It went down. I'm surprised. William Morales with the $5. Thank you so much. Uh, did you make it from scratch or use quick selection? I made my character the day Division 2 came out in 2019. I customized my whole my whole deal. I'm afraid I couldn't tell you the settings cuz I have no recollection or clue what they were 6 years ago. Um, but yeah, thank you very much for the $5. That's very generous of you. Oops. It's such a small Well, it's not a small thing, but I was going to say it's it's trivial, but just being in autumn is so refreshing compared to the summer, having some different colors, having all the stuff. Think they're coming from that way. I got to learn all the spawn points. Hey, they're spawning up from where that little mission was in day one. Yeah, never try and Oh, I thought you were dead. There we go. First control point done. Oh, and we can claim the resource convoy, too. Supply room access. Where was the resource? Over here. I have no idea where that even started. It doesn't matter too much. By the way, I should probably see if I can't get a Brooklyn one here. Brooklyn. Brooklyn. Here we go. Complete an activity in Dumbo. Well, too bad I didn't have that already, but that's fine. I wonder if that's how All right, let's check this. Uh, by the way, look up here. Okay, 17K on Twitch. Nice. Hell yeah. It's going to be a big day. I mean, of course, that'll wear down over time. It's It's not the largest DLC in the world, but it's really cool to see Division having that moment. Oh, they got a cleaner box in here. I can't get any materials, though, cuz I'm all full up from uh from spending my watch points yesterday. Which, by the way, I should probably check that. Did we get all of the uh Oh, yep. We got all our points back. I'm capped out on everything. Uh, give me one second to do [Music] this. And Switch back here. A thousand people in the stream is crazy, by the way, folks. Again, thank you for being here. All right. Well, where I was originally trying to go when I walked over here was right on over to this door. Does anyone know what this door signifies and what is up those stairs right there? Salute to the first person who says it in the chat. Art machine said, \"I know that door.\" Art machine Scott got it. Let's go look. I have no This I did not um take the time to come and see during the demo that I played. Oh, there's actually new uh apparel items to find in the world. That's awesome. I had no idea. A Kerman Caffy. Kerman Cafe. Kerman coffee cap. Hell yeah, dude. All right, that's cool. Oh, we get to go in. Dang, dude. More apparel. Hell yeah. How wild. It's the exact same exact same setup. Missed opportunity to not put like a bunch of footprints on the floor leading up to this desk where the line was. I wonder if this is going to be used for one of the hunter puzzles in any way. What is this stuff? That's part of a [Music] warhound. That's interesting. I bet this room is going to be used for something. Check your journey and claim the rewards. I just got a cash of the whole measured assembly gear set. I don't think I've done enough yet to claim it. Oh, yeah. But for tier three, you get season set in the blueprints. That's nice. So, out of cash, journey build journey build cash. So, are they tying that into the uh the milestone cash thing? Oh, there's no mask this time. That's too bad. All right. Well, anyway, these are all the same. I was actually in the safe room like last night on div one. I went in just to check it out and this is all the exact same. This is like a one to one. That's really cool. All right, we got that out of the way. Had to had to make a detour to see that. Got people attacking the control point up here now. Uh to people asking, I'm on Xbox. If there's issues happening on other other platforms, I'm afraid I don't have any information or a solution for you right now. I've I've just been focusing on my own my own thing over here. Um, here. Let me switch to the skin real quick. I'm trying to link up with a with a friend to play through the missions, but for whatever reason, parties don't want to seem to work. There we go. All right, you're at the settlement. Sweet. Let me switch it back here. [Music] Um, I don't think they'll be able to hear you, but that's okay. There's going to be a lot of a lot of cut scenes and all that. Anyway, get in here. We'll twoman this. You have been promoted to group leader. Uh, people asking how I got the one strap backpack. There's one available in the shop right now. With the failout bundle. Um, but additionally, the one you get from the uh what's it called? The journey, the new gear set is also a one strap. If you complete journey tier three, you'll get a set of the new items and that includes the the measured assembly backpack is also one strap. So, you don't have to to pay for it if you don't want to. Oh, yeah. Day one. Did you see the uh did you see the save room? Yeah. Hell yeah. I don't know where the actual safe room is for this uh zone. I guess we'll have to go through. You want to start running over to the clinicity? People are saying purchase the DLC. Still can't go to Brooklyn. It's day one. There's probably going to be some issues. That's pretty typical of most uh of most things, unfortunately. What' you say? That's true. Anyone in the Shadows Zone console, be sure that you actually went and installed the DLC purchase cuz sometimes it doesn't automatically install it in your game files. going to show triangle circle. This is a propaganda. You want to do this quick. I I found a priority objective for Brooklyn. It was do an activity in this zone. So, this will actually give me a thing. Plus, we got to if you see any weird hunter mask looking stuff like secrets, that could that could be a riddle. There's eight of them. We take [Music] Do you mean understand worth an hour or wait a couple days if you're going to get it regardless? I mean, if you're if you don't want to go through the hassle of launch day issues, then it doesn't hurt to wait a couple days. But I've had no issues so far, as you all have seen. But apparently there's some connectivity issues on different platforms. Uh, by the way, you should make sure you go in and equip. We have one of the active modifiers ready to go. It doesn't make you unlock it. All the modifiers are div one style. You get firearms and stamina and all that. key detected. Helios is in Brooklyn. Nice. Uh Daxi, thank you so much. Glad you're enjoying him. We got a bunch of dudes pulling up. We'll help you out. We're so close. People saying on PC, not letting you go to Brooklyn. I'm afraid I I don't know, folks. I'm sorry. I've just been playing here. I don't have a ton of knowledge on what's going on right now. As always, be sure to watch uh The Division social channels. If it's a known issue, you can check Trello. They might be working on a fix already. I don't know. Got a lady death. No more Brooklyn objectives there. All right, we're slowly discovering the map here. It's still I mean even though it's smaller, look how many blocks we still have to go. There's like there's going to be a lot to peek at, you know, agent. By the way, if you'd rather me change it so that they can uh Oh, should we go down? You have to, dude. In a new new underground location, you have to. If you'd rather I change it so they can hear you, I can. I just got to go in the audio settings. All right. One sec. I'll switch it so that Yeah. So, I'm not talking to myself. Um audio. All right, people watching the stream, let me know if you can now hear my teammate. I'm just going to run through. I can turn him down, too, if he's too loud. He tends to be a yapper. What are these guys doing down here? Loud and clear. All right, they can hear you. Nice. Perfect. If he's too loud, just let me know and I can go in the party settings and turn it down. Well, this is just a small little cutout then. I didn't see any doors or anything. Yeah. Um, uh, Centrifugal said no spoilers about the cut scene at the skatepark. That is the one cut scene that I actually got to see during my demo, so I know which one you're talking about. I won't spoil it either until we get there, but I agree. It's very interesting. And the big mystery too that we learned in the trailer yesterday is they said you'd hear the cleaner guy say to the rest of them, \"You know what we came for. Find it and burn everything else.\" We don't know what they came for. So, there's there's some mysteries to to discover, but let's get over there. We're going making our way downtown. Walking. Um, Sophia said, \"Can't access Brooklyn on Xbox.\" Be sure that you installed Brooklyn in the game files. Sometimes it doesn't auto install it. Um, and then I've seen some people say you can try going through the map instead of talking to the pilot. Other than that, at this point, I'm not sure I know it worked for me the first time. So, everybody, you can see as we get further away from the settlement here, things start to get more and more burned and charred because this is where they where the invasion started. Uh, Monkey Man, the new exotic mask that you get from this DLC, the catalyst does give you that ability. It allows you to shoot while you're on fire. So, they tried to tailor it to be kind of relevant to the the content of the DLC here. Oh, yeah. And now we're just in fullon scorched earth territory. Look at this. That got dreary fast. This is wild that we have a new world to explore after 5 years. All right, first side mission here. It's on heroic. Let's get it. Thank you for coming, Agent. We need you to sweep for survivors and secure the clinic. So, yeah, this one and one more side mission and the first main mission I've played the rest of this one wasn't too bad. The next one Oh, you disconnected. No, you didn't. Can you hear me? Yeah, I am. On my screen, it says you're disconnected, but I still see you running around. We found our first bug. Yeah, that stuff hurts. Uh, there's no new dark zone in Brooklyn for people asking in the chat, unfortunately. online. Hey, you're back online. Congrats. Yeah, I made it back. Hostile radio intercepted. Barricaded the gate to the clinic as ordered. Agents on sight with no way out. With no way out. Who do they think we are? sends or witnesses. You have to keep our way out is through them. Hostiles detected. Season level up. Look at you using the showstopper. Yeah, one vibes. Um, by the way guys, still thank you so much for nearly 1150 people watching the stream. Over 400 likes. This is already an amazing launch day. Thanks for being here. I'm one of those guys. Can't go up unless I go. You cheated. Yeah, I just morphed through you, dude. Restock. He said, \"Let me in.\" But yeah, big change, everybody. If you didn't see some of my videos, that side missions are now replayable. So, this one we're doing now, you can go back and change the difficulty on and redo after you complete it if you like, and they'll have targeted loot allocated. Those exodus are nice though. Yeah. These guys are kind of beefy. I respect that they're not a pushover. I mean, we're spawn camping them, but you know, they still take some hits. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, we got to go back through here. I see. Perfect. No survivors. All that's left is the agent. Eliminate. Kill those cleaners. Portable device. someone. Oh. They're dropping out of the ceiling. That's actually sick. Oh, we got an echo. A Hoskins, Dr. Thompson, are you safe? For now, we're in the fire escape. Should buy you an hour to get us. That's good. Help is on the way. We should have an hour. But you should have three. What are you talking about? The doors. Each one. take 30 minutes to burn at least. We barricaded ourselves in a room in the ICU, but the fire burned through the door in less than 10 minutes. The fire escapes for 3 hours, but who knows? How long have you been there? 15 minutes. We're coming. Help is coming. Just please be safe. Thanks, Melanie. There's no way out, so I'm counting on you to be my hero. I don't know if they made it out. Gonna be real with him. [\u00a0__\u00a0] need to pay. Trish didn't die for nothing. We can't let it looks like that comm is upstairs. Here we go. Is it ready? Yes. Danver. It's a classic classic mode of transportation. I'll send a gift to your crew at the workshop. Now all I need is my little flame turret set up at the top. Easy money. Wait, wait, wait. Hang on, hang on. This comm Oh, shoot. It closed. All right. Well, I'll have to come back. The comm was It was above us before, but now it's below us when we go up here. So, we must have missed a room. Oh, well. This is the last part right here. I struggled so much in this room in the demo when I was like a level 31 character on hard or not 31, I was 40, but I just had no gear. Why don't waste the bullet? move the supplies you recovered back to the bridge. We'll find Danver and make him pay for this. I'll check in with scouts. So, Danver must must be one of our main main dudes. Um, Dumbo, I'll send the coordinates to your HUD. Let's see. Will it let us go back down those stairs now? Oh, I will. Aha. Here it is. Go. No, I can't leave the patients. We can't afford to lose you, Trish. The ones that are ambulatory, we should evacuate. But we got broken legs. People recovering from giving birth. They can't run. We need to get them to a fire evacuation point. Closest one. The room's over there. They have fire rated doors. We can barricade and save some time. You go to the safe house for help. Yes. Run. Go now. Out the window. Is this another control point? No, it's terrible. If we find a uh I'm trying to half listen to the coms we go through. If we find a plug execution, we should do it to get the bounty. See one of the bounty locations. any new gear sets or exotics? Uh, yes to both within the season though, not strictly tied to Brooklyn. So, the new season came out today with all the stuff, new journey, new season pass, all of it. Got a bunch of stuff to claim there, but I think I'll do it later. Um, I have to run that way. Just get it. What does smart cover do? It buffs up uh certain pieces of cover and then when you're sitting in that cover, you get buffs. There's a defensive and an offensive variant. that give you bonuses for that. World is pretty good so far. Also, aside from the There's another com if you want it. Aside from the weird thing where it said you're offline, I haven't seen any bugs, which is decent for a for a Division launch. Sick art. Yeah. On the wall there. New graffiti dropped. He's kicking one shotgun show. How do you play the DLC? Once you buy it, be sure it's installed if you're on console in like your install files. And then um you can either talk to the pilot or go via the map. Apparently some people are having issues. I'm afraid I don't have any info on that at this point. Mine worked just fine, but stay tuned on the Division social pages if they're posting about any known issues. All right. I will say out of the two side missions that I played, this one was the cooler one. And there's a cut scene at the end. So, let's get it. Dumbo. We need to take them out. Okay, let's go Dumbo. Let's go, Dumbo. That's cool. The skateboard with the lights up there. Oh, true. Postman, I did see that one before I went live. Manny, he does repeat his audio a few times. I'm just thinking back to the day when Warlords launched when you like couldn't go to the next mission. It was like a progression blocker where you couldn't talk to the NPC. That was pretty bad. Fingers crossed we don't run into anything like that today, but we'll see. Hostiles. Yeah, this room is pretty cool. I thought LED lights always went out over everything else. We need to secure the rest of the building. Easy, easy. Mar said, \"My stash got wiped. How can I fix it?\" Uh, I would recommend reaching out to Ubisoft support. That's probably the one and only uh method you would have, but I'm sorry to hear that. That is tough. Sorry, I was just glancing at some of these things. I got um more apparel. Striped pants. That's cool that they put more stuff in the backpack. So, I feel like they didn't even do that for if I'm remembering right. What build am I using right here? Ongoing directive blue screen momento. It's a very, very good one. Crowd control and all that. Need to open all these caches. at some point. I have 17. You can do them right now if you want. What backpack is that? It is the Do you mean my gear one? If so, it's the Momento exotic pack. If you mean my apparel one, it's the failed backpack that's in the store as of this morning. I splurged for the stream. I knew you all would want to see the one strap. Um, once again people, I'll keep saying it throughout the entire stream. Thank you so much for,00 people being in here watching. We are also two likes away from 500 likes. If you've not hit the like button yet and you want to help support, it's a fantastic way to do so. Helps push the stream to even more people. We're only an hour in. We're going to be going for quite a while today. So, I would appreciate it. I still have all my Brooklyn activation caches. Let's see if I get a raid exotic out of me. Oh, ox pecker last the 500. Thank you very much. Oh, good lord. It shot up to 600. You guys are insane. Thank you for that. No exotics out of there. Tough. Clear all this out. I wonder when we get uh smart cover. All right, I'm good. Whenever you are. Yep. Good. Oo, more lights. Hostiles detected. Sorry. It's funny when they're like mid-sentence on an insult and then they die. Hostiles on the roof. I'm a little confused. How do you get to Brooklyn? You can either talk to the pilot or there's a note on the map. Do it either or. Well, not either cuz one way will get you there. All right. But I will say the final room of this mission in my demo, this is where I died the most. I died like seven times, but again, I was Can you get it through there? Yeah, that's funny. Listen, I know you're nervous. New collectible acquired direct. We just need to perfect the timing on the shot and the squib. The team's more comfortable with you. Besides, I need to get back to Violet. She needs her afternoon walkies. You've got this. Thanks, Grant. I won't let you down. All you have to do is try. If we don't get it today, it's fine. No producers breathing down our neck. No production deadline. We will get it done when we get it done. And when hostiles detected, cut mine off. Tough. Um, yeah. Fresh level 40 with like no expertise. I was struggling in the last room of this, but I bet we'll Hey, we'll breeze through it. Intel detected on laptop. We need to know what the cleaners are up to. Agent, get that intel. I'm still seeing tons of questions in the chat about accessing the DLC. I'm afraid I I don't know, my friends. I don't have the information. Mine worked when I loaded it up. I bought it this morning and logged in and got to play, but if there's issues going on, I'm afraid I don't know at the moment. As always, my my best recommendation is keep an eye on the known issues board, which there should be a link for in the description of the stream. Keep an eye on the Division's uh Discord and and Twitter pages. If there's stuff going on, they'll post about it. As is usually the case with live game day one launches, there are bound to be some issues here and there. So, give it some time. The DLC will be here in 4 hours or tomorrow or whenever. You're not going to miss out. They just got to fix up whatever's going on. Let's do it. Super long rope. Great. I got an F2000. Coffee cap. MFD said I found one of the hunter riddles. No way. Yeah, this is the room in here that gave me so much trouble. We'll see how we do. So, these turrets are going to spin up and shoot fire. Just so you know, there's one on either side. Hostiles incoming. Yeah, when you have all the buffs that we do, you can just stand out of cover and moan down. Hostile reinforcements on route. They are chunky once they get down to the health segment. Good lord. Um, it's about to play a cut scene, by the I'm going to record it. Mhm. Just so as you know, or I've been recording, but we'll go there. All right, here we go. Uh, chat, this cut scene is pretty interesting. If you don't want spoilers, be aware it's about to play a cut scene, but this is pretty interesting. Maybe. Oh, locate. Oh, it's over here. I was like, \"What?\" Agent, see if there's any video on those computers. Here it goes. Swear you're feelalty to me or face the consequences. Cut. What? You're doing great. Just the line is loyalty, not feelalty. Right. But what did I say? Feelalty. Other than that, it's perfect. Just uh feelalty makes him sound like a medieval feudal lord and uh you know, he's not that far gone. Not yet. Right. Uh right. Okay. Let's uh let's go again. Swear your loyalty to me or face the consequences. [\u00a0__\u00a0] you, Kina. Cut. Uh all right. We know what we need to do. Let's uh reset. Bring in another car and a new wardrobe for our city. Interesting. So, they're using the descent tech to basically deep fakes in the division. Who knows what other lies they've been telling about us. AI dude is taking over AIS. [Music] Um, what was I going to say? Oh, somebody in the chat was asking, \"How do you get the onestrap bags?\" There's two available right now. One is uh store purchase, which is what I'm wearing right now. But additionally, the new gear set backpack is a one strap. You don't have to pay for that. You can just farm it in targeted loot or get it from the journey. So, two options for it. Um, all right. Fast travel one back. I mean, it's certainly a handy tool for it, Postman, you know. But that's what I was saying, guys, when people were asking like how can the story not be tied to the main story, but it's still loosely related. That's kind of what we're what we're seeing so far. Again, I've only played I played the main mission that we do after this. I've not played anything after that. I have no idea what's going to happen there. Oh, what did she say? It doesn't matter. I was just linking to you. I just I thought it would have both of us do it, but I guess that makes sense that it just takes one. Oh, there's another comm over here. Oh, by the way, guys, these are some of the characters that we've been hearing about in the coms. Rolls. They're just got a division watch, social director. Yeah, you're kind. Oh, they're playing a movie. organizing and it keeps me back at the base and hanging out with other people's kids. Good training for what's next. Or being with other people's kids will make me hate kids. Or they will fall in love with you and the baby. Wow, this movie is really funny. It looks like Do you remember the one in the Division One uh in the Boo honestly? Oh yeah. Where was like Black and White? It looks like that. That's fair. candle would never and Hoskins should never. I was trying to find earlier where the wall would be for the new hunter masks, but I couldn't find anything. Yell at them to slow down and screaming, \"What are you doing? You're going to break your neck.\" Maybe there's not one. I just figured there would be. What do you think you're doing? You're going to break something, you little punk. There's another here. Okay. I grabbed that one earlier. I think there are three. There were two that I found and then that third one just now. Oh, yeah. There's one here, too. prenatal vitamin little agents. Look at them. The division next generation. Hoskins already. I'm wondering where this goes. We can't go up here yet. Yep. If we get to it all, but it seems like we would be able to go at least three times a week. Little dog. There's like hightech pics. They could be from real life. I don't know. Let me find it. Yeah, you should really be eating small fish like sardines and herring. Mackerel is okay, but um All right, next up is the main the first main mission. Think you're all set? I've been poisoning her. No, you haven't. Look at that striker build. We are what we eat. And when you're growing a fetus, it helps Eat as cleanly as possible. Um, eat more eggs and veggies. Don't drink wine and just make the best choices you can. That's all we can travel or just run. Patricia, I'm going to listen later to your talking about food. Um, we have to fast travel. They're all off site, but I'll ceue it up if you're all good. Let's hit it. So Chad, this next mission that we're going to do, this is the last thing that I played in the demo. So after this mission, I've not play I I don't know what's going to happen, but this mission is pretty fun. This is probably my favorite part of the of the demo. And here we are. So, by them making the missions offsite, you can see that we get like a pretty unique location here compared to the streets that we've already seen. So, again, I don't know where the other two will be, but that part's cool. Um, all right, we'll find you and shut it down. The purple flame workshop? Hostiles ahead. I'm not look I'm not used to looking up for ads. Did you see his body fly off of the railing there? Yeah. Yeah, that was funny. But yeah, that was that was a recurring theme through this is there kept being like snipers above that I had to watch out for. Hile forces on sight. Eliminate the threat. We have work to do. People who are in a loading screen that seems loading screen screen that seems endless. I saw somebody say earlier that even though it looks endless, they did get through it eventually after like 10 minutes or so. So maybe just give it a few more. I don't know. Unfortunately, neither neither of us ran into those issues, so I can't give you any personal advice. Uh turrets coming up. We got to find the boxes. Like one's Yeah, you got that one. Turret disabled. Additional turret still online. I don't know why they put an objective point on it. Follow the line. Ouch. Don't have a shot. Keep going. We need to find the workshop. You must find the workshop. A new gear set. Flame. Oh, did you get it? Weapon damage, increased threat, and pistol. Yeah, the new brand. The one piece having another one piece weapon damage is nice cuz the only one before is Walker. Yeah. Path locked ahead. Agent required to circumvent locked security door. Uh, yellow box. I was like, I know it's somewhere. Door status update unlocked. The workshop. Hearing a few people say their stash issue cleared itself up after some time. Oh, that's good. So, maybe it's just when you first log in, for whatever reason, the staff hasn't loaded in, but then it pops in after. Kind of like the synchronization, cuz that would be very bad if there was an issue where entire stashes were missing. So, if anyone's running into that, try try giving it some time, seeing what happens. You just have to relog and it will fix the stash issue. Okay, that's good. Cuz that would put a serious a serious damper on the launch, I would say. That was like earlier when that guy said, \"My stash is gone. What should I do?\" I was like, \"Uh, refueling disabled.\" Additional hostile agent. immediate medical assistance needed. Spawn camp extreme. Intel detected on laptop. [\u00a0__\u00a0] cleaners. We need to kill them before they hurt any more innocent people. I can't do this anymore. Take a walk. Can't do this anymore. She best blow her lid off. She's not even here, dude. She's a division agent. Why can't she help us? Uh, yes. I'm using the blue screen exotic LMG for those asking. What are you looking at? Trying to trying to read the notes. There could be some hidden details. Well, dude, this boss that we're about to fight soon is gets kind of crazy. Oh, someone's got a picture of a doggo shot located. Where at up here? Uh, yeah. Bottom left by the chair. I bet there's people those might be people's real dogs on the dev team. That'd be funny. Not the gray box. See, this skybox is cool. I think with all the smoke, the red lights. It is sick. I'll kill you. Agent, you saw what the purple flame did to the clinic. If you want to blow something up, please go blow that up. Oh, I want to blow something up. Little loot room back here. Where's the box? Or maybe it's a uh No, I don't know. Oh, you know what? I think that might be where we go next if I'm remembering right. We do this then go back there. All right. I'm telling you guys, and I didn't spoil it in my preview video, but get ready for the boss in this room. Ah yeah. Scanning for operational weak points. Multiple weak points. Will cause error. Eliminate the hostiles. The effort is carrying on anymore. Get violent. We got a few behind us. access to the workshop. All right. Are you ready, Chad? You ready for this? I mean, it's not it's not like that crazy, but it's it's interesting. Oh, no. Violet. Warhound with Oh, immediate just bomb. Oh, it's so much squishier in this dude. I'm telling you, on in the demo, it took me like 10 solid minutes to kill this thing. I just had no damage. Oh, immediate down, but I am running earning six reds. I got you, too. Ah, I'm good. I'm good. I'm not even Ah, I'm good. Yeah, it's no joke. But it's way squishier in this balancing or at least on this character. Almost dead. Yeah. Yeah, I kind of wish it was tankier, but it had more weak points. That was kind of my feedback before was like it's just kind of a health pool boss, which is cool. Yeah, it barks. Exactly, Westy. Well, when it jumps down, it makes like a big loud w It's cool. Did they reanimate Joe Faroh's body? Now, you're right. That would have been the coolest cleaner boss they could have come up with. Danver needs the shipment. Send the boat. Okay. What's this? Dan requested a purple flame delivery. Agent, you need Oh, this is how you open this door. Uh, Michael, the new modifier is called hardcore. electronic device. Got to calm down here, I think. Chat in a case. Are you sure you can meet the production deadline? As long as we should be fine. Oh, hell yeah. This isn't rocket science, but it is science. We have a fixed reason we produce given I still need a 10% false resisting. We can hit that target. Did you get the first delivery? We did. We need more reinforcements. They'll never make it in time. You know what to do. Copy that. You know what to do. I don't know what to do. Do you know what to do? I've never learned. Uh key. No, this is just the first mission. There are three main missions in total. So, we've still got a good amount of stuff to go through. Spawn closet. hostile reinforcements on Michael with the five gifted memberships. Thank you so much, dude. Timothy Angry andJ Chris, welcome to Rogue Studios. If you're here, please give him a thank you in the chat. Thank you as always for the generosity, man. That's very kind of you. System. Uh, climb up there on the truck. Oh, no. In here. Portable device. Portable device. There's so many. How does the test go? All success. We didn't get a chance to performed beyond our expectations. Do you hear what they're saying in this comm? They're talking about the incursion, but he just said we didn't get a chance to test our newest weapon. There's going to be some some stuff going down in these last two missions. I think Martinez. Yeah, he lost Johnson Martinez. We took him out. Oh yeah, classic explosion. Backup won't get here in time. There's the clap. Activating the self-destruct. Agent, stop the self-destruct. We need the refinery to keep New York going. We need the refinery. All right. Explosions everywhere. Self-destruct sequence initiated. Syncing countdown to your HUD. Agent refiner infrastructure corrupted. Decrease pressure to prevent explosion. Is your mic all good? I'm sounding weird for a second. Yeah. Okay. Oh, I got you. Very curious. Thanks, Oh, we need we have a timer. I just realized. Uh, four pressure valves. I think there's, if I'm remembering right, there's two down here, one up or two and two. I'll look up top. Oh, yeah. They have green lights next to them with the the little number counter like an iron horse. What do I have to do to it, though? I just interact. Just turn the turn the valve. My FPS dropped a little bit there. One more. I think I see it back here. Unless you already got this one. Uhuh. No, I got it. I'm curious to see how this boss goes cuz I had some feedback on how this one worked. But of course, that was pretty close to the launch. Seal it is. We need you back at the bridge. We're under attack. They need to save the refinery. They're under attack at the bridge. SEO is trying to fix it. We're under siege and our best ops are in the field. Well, shoot. We have bigger fishing fire over here. Yeah, we're trying to save this place. But that is the benefit of a linear campaign is they can script all these events. Too smart for you. You're too late. Boss here. Oh, they did change him. At least I think that's not what his armor looked like in the demo. Is he immune or does he take damage? He does take damage. The way you're the kind of mechanic is that if you pull him by the Oh, I'm getting lit up. If you hit the the running after you. Oh god. If you hit the little valves, like there's one right here. It creates a little explosion. If you lead him, if you kite him in, it's supposed to damage him. Dude, I can't catch a break. Anywhere I go, I'm getting lit up. He is sprinting after me. So here, if you lead him back to me, let's try and pull him in this thing. Damn. I'll wait till he gets close. So there. Yeah. See that? Did a lot of damage still. Okay. So they did they did improve it. That's way different than when I played. That's really cool. I like when missions have like light mechanics to a degree, but you can still just shoot him if you can't get through that. We've got enough damage to take him out. Probably. Serious. These guys hurt though. I'm I'm out of kits. I'm dead. I've got no hive either. Oh no. You can you can just Oh my goodness. No, we're not. Oh, you still drive. You're dead again. I have no kids. tough. I respect it. I respect that they made that harder. It should be hard if you're playing on heroic. All right, we just have the last room again. We have a huge play space here, though. We can we can kite him around super far. We don't have to stay down here, so I'm going to I'm going to run these guys back a little bit and clear some of them out. And we can we can kite him to more of the um more of the pipes. There's a bunch of them all over the the arena. Yeah, I love that they went and changed that cuz I'm telling you it was not it was a lot different when I played it. Um if he runs Oh, nice. Got him with that one. There's another one back here if he starts chasing you. I'm standing on one. I'm going to kit and then run to you. Okay. Now he's just walking. Oh, this guy dropped my T. Oh, he's almost dead anyway. Wow, he hurts. Here we go. Here we go. Damn, his armor's broke. He his health is like a raid boss. Oh, I got an exotic exotic, too. Imperial Dynasty. What' you get? An Imperial Dynasty. Catastrophic failure. Imagine they'd reworked it. We didn't know. to the extraction point. Update coordinates to extraction point. All right, that was fun. I like that fight. I'm glad they changed it. Um, so yeah, we got Xville. There might be like a a post mission sequence after this cuz they're saying the bridge is under attack. I don't even know where the exit is. There's stairs back here. Oh, you found some. Yeah. Yeah. Yellow cord. Oh, is there a secret? Wait, maybe it might have just been for the pipes. No. Yeah, it's just for that. Follow him around. Yeah. All right, there we go, chat. That was main mission one. I thought it was fun. Yeah, it was good. Now, we'll see what happens. But we lost the we lost the plant. We did not succeed. Oh, that tower fell down. Dang. It's kind of like White Oak back in the day when we failed to get Ellis. We We did not succeed. They got a complete. I call it a complete. What' you say? Are Oh, it separated us. We choose to go back to the base. Is this like a solo sequence? Maybe we'll find out. If it is, we helicopter. Yeah, if it is, we can just play throw it on our own. That's fine. Group up after cuz it said the bridge is under attack. Hostile. Oh, yep. There's a whole thing going on here. The DC is still alive. All right. So, play through it solo and then link up after. Oh, wait. Were you able to join? Yeah, I think it's cuz I clicked X on the Okay. Well, this is cool. Little group leader. Actual urgent mission here. You are now group leader. All right. Again, I'll emphasize chat. After this point, I've played none of the none of this content, so I have no idea what's gonna happen. My DLC demo ended at the end of that last mission. There are some stuff going down right now. Yeah, I'm getting shot at by like I see purple here. I thought it was something. Look at that. Oh, this is sick. This is sick. The enemies are super squishy cuz I don't think we're on like story difficulty, but this set piece here is kind of tight. This is so [\u00a0__\u00a0] I found a weak point here. There's one more on your side probably. Loc. Ow. Yeah, that thing hurt. Nice. Hostile defenses disabled. Hostile detected. Eliminating Mug Boy. We're losing too many people. Oh, there's a shield boy. It's too bad this is so easy difficulty wise, but oh well. Um, everyone who's saying they lost their stash, try relogging your game. Um, people have said that fixed it for them. Also, if you just give it a few minutes, it should kick in is what I've heard. What the freak is going on in there? A lot. Fighting for their life in there, dude. Yeah. You ready? Yeah. Secure. Oh. That was it. That was all propaganda to approach. Meet me in the basement. Oh, Theo's here now. All right, let's do it. Cut scene. Agent, I want to thank you for keeping Moral and the baby safe. Good. You're back. You're in charge. Next time you and Kener decide to go on a road trip, get someone else to guard your secrets. Come on. It couldn't have been that hard being the leader. The [\u00a0__\u00a0] cleaners took Jess and they burned down the clinic. Okay, but you're fine. We're fine. Plus, I got back in time for the birth. Don't be your dad, Theo. Okay, look. I'm here. I would have been here sooner, but I needed to convince Manny he could trust me. Good luck with that. Don't mind Hoskins. Her sister was a cleaner. She'll get over it. Now that I'm back, let's activate the ultimate backup. Oh, is this where we get some more cover? Why don't you do the honors? Oh, no. What? Oh. Oh. [Music] Oh, coordination. What on earth is this? We got our own drone. Rogue shade skill acquired. Rogue shade skill. New skill. Oh, it's just smart cover. Oh, there's cover. Wait, that was so confusing. Why did we launch a drone and then we got I thought I was about to say we get a drone and like they hid an entire skill, but we got that. Okay. Oh, I see what's Okay. What was up with that drone then? I'm so confused. So, we have Theo here now. Brooklyn Heights and has pinged their location on your map. Electronic device. May I introduce to you the ultimate backup? The first ever remote shade. Black Tusk Marauder. Oh, the shade server's controlling the Marauder. Well, turns out the Marauders guiding system is Anna with her voice disabled. So, we just enabled it and switched a couple of the network pathways and had to sync it with the rogue network. Of course, so that not anyone with a mobile shade server could take control of the Marauder. Anyone else know about your special project? Of course not. Is any working hard or hardly working? This guy's just aimlessly staring at the wall. Working hard or hardly working? No monitor even on her life. She is my best friend and the finest. Oh, this is the wall. You know I'm older than you, right? Oh, look. Ash keys. This is where we'll get the new the new thing. So, there's going to be eight masks and then eight keys and we get the ash chest. Hell yeah. Um I got to look. We have smart cover in here. Yes, we do. I'm going to run it because why not? Oh, they nerfed the amount of damage targets out of cover. That's funny. They knew it was going to be too much. But even at tier, Hold on. What am I at right now? I'm at one skill tier and I get 17% damage to target side of cover and 40% weapon handling. And it lasts for 45 seconds. That's good, dude. I'm going to rock the the precision one. Oh, it looks sick on the backpack. So, wait. If we go outside now, are we going to see that drone flying around? I guess not. I'm just confused why they showed that to us like that. There's two bounties on this bounty board. Are there bounty? Oh, they're all low. The highest one goes to challenging. I say we wait till we find a public execution. So, it's actually heroic. Um I might take a quick Oh, view upgrade. There's the middle spot here. Nice. I might take a quick 60 seconds to fill up my water and use Elbanio. Um, if you want to do the same, you can or you can entertain the stream. Uh, chat, I'm going to do that really quickly. I'll be right back. I'll play some music. Maybe Nova Hub will entertain you. Uh, give me like two minutes. Be right back. Well, I got your entertainment down. Ding ding ding ding ding ding. Are you guys entertained? put your change in the bucket and go to the store, right? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. [Music] Now we're not entertained. Somebody said we're It was a noise. Stop. I'm an entertainer. Show you these moves instead. No DLC or no new DZ. Why do you play Division 2? That's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] That's a good question. Shh. He's back. He's back. He's coming back. Sh. Everybody hide. Everybody hide. What'd you do? All right, I'm back. Um, I entertained. All right, perfect. I'm going to trust it all went well. No one in the chat. One person called me annoying. That's a That's a win then. By the way, we still have 1.1,000 people in here watching the stream. Again, thank you all so much for being here. This is insane. How fun is this that we have a launch day for a new DLC? Over 750 likes as well. Thank you all. My goodness. Um, me readjust my mic here. We're in it for the long haul, folks. That's why I figured I would take a break because we're we're going all the way. So, we got smart cover. We have a new world mission over at Clark Street. You want to head that way? Let's do it. Oh, I need to stop my recording. It's now 34 minutes long. I started it back during the last mission. All right. Well, I assume that drone is going to come into play at some point because there's no reason they didn't just show us that for no reason. They were like, \"Hey, here's this crazy flying drone.\" And now it's gone. All right. Yeah. If we see a public execution on the way, we should do it. By the way, be sure to check your uh if you completed any of the journey objectives. I can I can claim journey three right now. That was a lot of rewards. Season pass level 26. There's still no passive mods, but we did get target rich environment. I don't know what stamina mark, electronics mark, firearms. It's going to take a while to figure it all out. I got the final measure cash though. I'm going to open it up. Final armor, final mask. I'm telling you guys, I've got to build back out of that. I got to build prep for this thing. I think it's going to be good. They buffed it, too. You get explosive resistance on the three-piece and they buffed the cool down time. How's the DLC so far? I'm having fun. I think if you go in with the right expectations of it being a smaller package than Warlords, you're going to have a fun time. But I mean, we've been playing for two hours. We still got two of the main missions to go, two side missions, bunch of the map to explore, all the riddles. So, there's a good amount here. Achievement. Oh, yeah. I have my notifications off, but I've probably been getting some. Discover four control points in Brooklyn. Did we discover another control point? Oh, look at these. Look at these golden autumn streets. Actually, what is this activity here? This is always what happens when there's a new map. There's like 10 different things you want to go and look at. What's a control point? Oh, it's territorial control. Yeah, boring. Postman said, \"What's the build?\" I'll give you the preview. I need I'm not going to try and test it now, but the idea here is birdies, which they fixed apparently. Oh, they changed it as well. They changed the revive speed back to 80. I'll have to test that. Apparently, they fixed birdies, but it's that I'm going to swap y'all for one Alps and then do four final of measure. And it's like a healer revor PvP build. I think it's going to be good, but I need to test it. We'll try that on my own time. So, this is the other zone, which I'd say so far looks pretty different from There's a Isn't there like a control point? Oh, yeah. It's right here. Oh, in the tower. You want to do this? Yeah. Yeah. Rockets, though. Watch out. Just zoomed right past my ass. This These ones have the wires as well. If we figure out where the weak point is. That almost took you out as I run through your smell cloud. Oh, I forgot we have smart cover here. I'm going to pop it. Smart cover is active. We're getting 17% damage targets out of cover. So, it just pops into the cover that we're on. by dude. Rikers are always the most tanky dudes. Oh, there's another defense here. We have the shock panels on the floor. So, yeah, they should also be able to be disabled somewhere. Yeah. Oh, but those hurt. They hurt. They hurt. They hurt. Serious trauma detected. I got one turret down. Okay, I'm trying to look for the other one. Oh, and now I don't have my self res. That's the problem with me taking that off. Oh, the leader's going to get me. They're here. Don't worry about it. I am the leader. You said move his head. Hiles nearby. I can't find the other. I'm going to put smart cover down if you want the buff. They spawned right on us. Yeah, they did. Good thing I've got line of sight for my buffed cover until they show up behind me. Exotic. More exotics. Nice. Bunch of ads over here. I don't know where the wire is going. I can't even look at it. There's so much happening. Like three times trying. Oh my goodness. Uh, you got the wire downstairs. Yeah. Where does this one go then? It's literally right next to us. Was it? Look, it's right here. Like I don't know where it is. Got him. Jeez, that was intense. Look, it was right here. Oh, good lord. Uh, they're coming from somewhere. Oh, behind wherever the boss comes from. I'm about to plop down that smart cover. Some guys right below us. There's a brief star that we are shooting at, didn't they? Yeah, nearby. Put on smart cover already. That's so many ads over there. I'm hitting this. I'm popping my link. Just lighting these dudes up. I need to put my other grenade on. [Music] More incoming hostiles. Oh, because we still have the resource. I feel like I'm on wave defense here. Just endless ads coming down the street. Nice. That was intense. Oh, just got blown up by a record trap. Um, TJ, I don't have a build for this exact setup, but I'm happy to show you in just a second here once we're sure that everything's clear. Um, here you go. Four ongoing directive with the chest piece because that gives you the huge damage spike. Momento backpack, contractor gloves, blue screen LMG. It's really strong. You get a lot of crowd control, a lot of damage. I I highly recommend your feelings. This is fun, man. New location, some new skill. Uh, we got the chest in here somewhere. Oh, this is it. I see. Hostiles guarding location nearby. All right, onward to side mission. Are you going to make a video about the known issues board? I have no idea, man. What's going on on there? I'm I'm very out of the loop. I started playing this once the servers have been up and I have done nothing else. I'm surprised we haven't run into any like world bosses or any of the hunter stuff yet. Map's not that big. Or maybe we have, we just missed it. Well, in order to spawn this hunter, you got to go shoot through three different windows and emote under certain lights. Got to wait until it's 3:46 p.m. and then you do a backflip and then I'm going to see what this activity is real quick. Uh, thank you for watching it, Ralph. I appreciate you being here. Another territory. Where are the public executions? I want people to be getting killed out here. All right, we'll just keep going. Something caught my eye. Oh, I got a new apparel drop. Blue jacket. You get apparel as well. Got a bunch of I always get a I'm getting a bunch of the blue jack. Actually haven't seen one of those blue drops in forever and I was like weirded out when I seen it. Well, yeah, cuz they we got all the ones in the main game, but they actually added new ones. It's cool. All right. I'm seeing a big flash. Oh, this light is 100% something. When it flashes red, you shoot green. And then the hunter drops out of the sky. I'll emote. I'll dance. I'll clap. I'll surrender. And then shoot it three times. All right. Next side mission. I got no idea what's I got to warm up. I got to warm up. I found some painkillers. Welcome to Riker City. All right, let's do it. Hostiles detected. The entrance is too heavily fortified. Anna is uploading the route to your hut. Tell me where to go. Anna. Oh, there could possibly be something on that window. My god. Look at this window up here. kind of sus. Up where? Above you. Yellow wire goes in speaker. True. Although I don't know if they could put one in the mission. I feel like they'll have to be out in the open world. I'm fun. Smart cover if you need some some extra detox. Oh, no recoil. I like that. Yeah, the weapon is nice, actually. I'm actually, I'm not going to lie, I'm kind of impressed that as far as the DLC content goes, we've had no bugs so far. I know there's issues with people's stashes taking a while to load in and that stuff and obviously that needs to get fixed, but so far so good. Oh, I got a smart cover mod. Plus seven more% damage targets out of cover. Holy. I'm putting that in right now. Oh, it's on cool down. That's pretty crazy. How did we just walk into a subway here? little subway mission throwback. Okay, here I'm going to put this in. Now I got 24% damage targets out of cover. Nice free sandwich. When you buy a medium or large coffee and say 425 All right. We're going through so many little rooms here. Yeah. Hostiles. I'm looking for like little Easter egg. There's bound to be stuff somewhere. I'm trying to land that nade right on the gunner. I can't. She's dead. Nice. They spawned at the bottom. I found the perfect mark of cover placement. Take out that agent. If the Rat Queen is going to make another play for the bridge, we need the Rat Queen. Get your [\u00a0__\u00a0] together and kill that [\u00a0__\u00a0] At least now we know what they've been protecting. Take out their supply routes so they can't make another play for the bridge. First we have the bullet king, then the bullet queen, and now the rat queen. Hostiles detected. What are all these servers we keep seeing? I don't know if that's that's like out of place or if that's just a just a thing. Oh my god. G36. Hostiles. Oh, shock on the floor. Ubie, please add chicken jockey. I like that comment. That's the important stuff. Oh, I see a I shot a thing panel. I think that did it. The short I don't see shock on the floor anymore. Oh, that's what it was for. Multiple fatalities. Multiple fatalities. Oh, they shocked him to die. That was brutal. Hostiles detected. Hey, they pulled us in the middle of the room. They're sitting dunks. I like that animation for putting smart cover on the I'm going to make Oh my. They spawn behind you, too. There's a lot of spawns in here. Um, slick comments is given to you once you complete after you complete the little story mission. That's after the first main mission. So, after you complete the H5 refinery and go back to the bridge, you'll be given it there. Identific. Oh, they got more. Wait, so can I just pop smart cover out of cover? Oh, no. You can't just click it. You have to aim it or be in cover. Oh my god, they crew took us from the pier and stole our IDs. Stole your IDs. Is that meant to be dramatic? Send a recovery team to get them back to the bridge. You need to get to the subway station. They stole our IDs. No. Here. One sec. I wonder what's in this gift. I like how it's just clipped through. They just like stacked entities in this corner. Clipped through a chair and a thing and Nice present though. You never know what you're going to get. I got a message that said, \"Whoever you're playing with in the stream is funny.\" I thank you. I guess I was like, \"No response. Just going to take it.\" In a good way. In a good way. That's good. That's good. That's good. Locate the depot. You missed my entertainment earlier. That's why they think I'm funny. I'm have to go back and watch the VOD later and see what you did while I was gone. Absolutely nothing. I rang my bell and talked to them. I sat in front of you just dinging the bell. That's perfect. Put the put the change in the the uh container before they go in the door. I feel like I'm playing survival loot in the subway. I've been playing survival, bro. I was standing next to the fire. Ever since I've seen a blue piece of clothing on the ground, I've been playing survival. If you're back in New York, then it has to be survival. Got you now, [\u00a0__\u00a0] in the subway. Secure the depot. Can't let down the rack. We've come too far. Use everything. All right. Zone two. This is a long side mission. Hostiles detected. I'm popping smart over here. Feel like we're about to be ambushed. Yep. [Music] Ow. I'm going down. I'm telling you, they're tanky once they get to the health segment. Thank you. They should be back at the bridge soon and hopefully we can figure out what the hell is going on. This new leader agent, we need to figure out what the Rikers are doing. Discovered main mission has confirmed that the cards of the dead. No, that's probably just the next side mission. I forget to keep saying that. Defense systems. Be careful, agent. I'm going to watch the uh the thing real quick. In the collectibles found footage, you gave us a new one. Oh, frenzy. You know that I have no No one does until they do it. All right, just hold this steady while I tighten this bolt and we should be good to go. Okay. Can you hurry up? I I don't know how much longer I can hold this thing. I'm done. Thank you. What's next? Nothing. This is really beautiful. Yeah. Think Moral will like it? She'll love it. I can't believe I'm going to be a dad. I can't believe you're going to ask her to marry you. What? You think she won't say yes? Oh, she'll say yes. You already knocked her up. No one wants to be a single mom with a notorious baby daddy. Excuse me. I'm not notorious. All right, that one wasn't quite as revvely as the other one. There's one more though that we're going to get at some point. Um, okay. So, I don't want to be spoiled. Thanks for streaming, though. Yeah, thank you for being here. Totally understandable if anyone jumps out so they don't see spoilers. I completely understand. We still have over 1,000 people watching though, which is insane. Thank you for that. Thank you for 850 likes. If you have not yet hit the like button and you want to help out, uh, I would appreciate you doing so. Stream's still just getting started. Really, we're still going to be going for a long time. So, if we break 1,000 likes, that would be amazing. But I appreciate everybody choosing to watch me when you could be watching other people or playing for yourself. So, thank you. Thank you. Okay, next is another side mission. We need to secure Heights. Let's head their way. Civilians in distress. Okay, I'm just walking right in front of my bullets. Who do you think you are? Trying to build my stacks. I don't even have stacks. I just got to get a kill. Oh, what's this activity? Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of propaganda. Yeah, it is. Where are the exec Oh, there it is. Public execution. You tried to You tried to fool me. Thank you. Detecting additional hostile contacts. There we go. Now we'll get a bounty. Let's do a bounty ch. Let's see what the Oh, wait. I got an exotic from that pestilence. Oh, one of the bears. Also, wait. I was going to check the they changed the icon here in the store. Actually, buy the pest skin. No, you can't. Oh, but they did add some skins to the stuff you can buy there. Are we on Asia servers? Are we looking social bottom line is Oh, yeah. Maybe the US ones are just like overloading cuz that some people are saying they can't even load in. Um, hostiles nearby. Yeah, let's do a bounty. Oh, it's far. We can run over there, though. See more of the map. Yeah. Yeah. Um, people are asking me about the code that is linked at the top of the chat. If there are issues with it, I'm afraid I don't have any good solutions for you or I'm unaware of what might be going on there. I It was given to me through the creator program. They said that it's an infinite use once per account code to get some cashes in game. Uh but again, if there are issues going on with it, I'll have to look into that later. I apologize. Wait, can we see? Oh, we can. You can see the Statue of Liberty out there. Dang, there's going to be a lot of stuff to explore over time. Bridge Park Kings. Oh, that's what they call themselves. Yeah, it's a Bridge Park or something. We're division agents. Yeah, I can drop this bag. Do what? Oh my goodness. There's like a rope over here. these that to drop the rope explosion. You can't just open up a rope and not use it. Unded operator said I might have had a hunter clue. Where's it at? Dude, if we figured out a hunter while we were live on stream, that'd be crazy. I doubt it because those things are usually very complex, but All right, here we go. We're going to check out a bounty. See See how it is. Oh my bunch of dudes behind us. Is that the next? Oh, yeah. We got to go this way. Something's looking fishy over here. Oh, I thought you I was so sure there was going to be like a fish design on the wall or something. I should have I should have put Should have waited for that. Cricket. Oh, the name 35% aside damage to enemies. Which talent is that? I forget. That's not a new one, but it is precision strike. Perfect. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it said it's at a resource note next to the bridge settlement. All right, we'll have to check it out next time we're over there. Oh, I see a ping for the safe house. I forgot that there are safe houseses to find. So, we'll hit that on our way back then once we're done with the bounty. I I I think they might actually give us pings for bounties if I'm not mistaken. Look at us breaking into the park. Oh, except this didn't this didn't go anywhere. Wait, this could be a clue. Wait, true. Why is this here? Jumping jacks. Jumping jacks. Quick. Yeah. What does this little trash pile mean? Well, that's not a jumping jack. Starts clapping. What build am I using? Blue screen for ongoing directive and momento with contractor's gloves. It's a very good solo damage and crowd control build. Yeah, that's going to do it. You shoot rifom on it. Yeah, try everything. There's a chair on top of the semi-truck right there. It's a good spot, I guess. Wait, where? You don't see the long chair on top of the semi-truck right there? I don't even see the truck. Oh, right here. That's funny. Yeah, it's a good vantage point. This is an ideal. Meanwhile, these dudes spawned in like five minutes ago. They're like, \"Can you come fight us already? Here we go. Oh, they're far away. I stirred my banshee pulse. I was like, I'll hit them, but they're not here. Mr. Nobody with the $10 super chat saying because it's a Tuesday live stream. I mean, more importantly, it's the Battle for Brooklyn launch day, but thank you so much, man. That's incredibly kind of you. Very much appreciated. I don't think this is the way we were supposed to go here. There's a box that goes all the way up. All right, we might have to go around the around the building. These guys have skills and everything. Oh, what's that about? Target. Good luck. Trying to hit that dude's drone back there. Nice. Good work. Thank you for keeping us safe, agent. All right. All right. Well, we did a bounty. We can head back to the I pinged the safe room and we'll keep going on the missions. Oh, there's another control point here. Want to hear this? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. More defenses to take out. I'm gonna go around the back. See if I can't find. Dude, things are so damn loud. Oh, there's a rocket back here, too. Good lord. I was like, \"Yeah, I'll find the That hurts. [Laughter] Yeah, they're not they're no joke. Here's Okay, I'm going to I'm going to take the dive. I I got one. I got the other. We should be good. The Riker's ones are so much more intense than the cleaners. Oh, the shot came back online. Or can you not disable that? No, there's just two more. I just shot two of them. Okay, so they have their own weak points. That's good, isn't it? Look at that purple sunrise. Make sure you're looking in all these windows. True. There's just a hunter watching from one of them. Can we not call the It's not letting me call the reinforcements. We might have found our first bug. You know, we don't need them. Well, you need them to trigger the the second half of the thing. guys don't show up if you don't shoot it. Oh, well. All right, first bug discovered onto the safe room. onward much. What did you find someone? No. I thought this could possibly be something over here. Be our new room. H. It's got a DC sticker on there. Two of them. I just I don't know how people are so good at like even finding that stuff cuz I'm like I don't even know where to begin. Yeah. You see a weird looking wall, you're like, \"Okay.\" You get so much new clothing, which is cool. Mhm. safe room. I'm head over. If you need to fast travel, you can. Yeah, I was sniffing out. under attack. Ran into a public on the way. Oh godamn it. Serious. All right, I'm going to save this bounty for later. Agent deactivate. What loadown am I using? I have got four ongoing directive, momento backpack, contractor's gloves, and the blue screen exotic LMG. It's a very strong load out. Can you obtain one strap uh look bags for free? Yes, the new gear set item is a one strap. Uh oh, look what the crashed uh look right here. You can shoot these, right? Hang on. I'm coming. Oh. Oh, we got the ambushers here. The trash can faction down there. All right. Sorry about Oh, the crate. I thought they were actually better than There's some cool graffiti over there. Uh 44 degrees. I forget you do have like a little number thing by the radar. Oh, up this way on this wall there's a cool graffiti piece. Oh, the dog. Uh, no. Oh, yes. Sorry, it is a dog. I couldn't see the top part of hers. Oh, this has got to be something. This is a puzzle. Blood. Oh, wait, wait. Look back. Right. Look. Yeah. In the window. You can shoot it. Oh, wait. What? Oh, yeah. Do it. You do it. I'm scared. Open that door. Well, this valve is in is There's a valve there, but it's not interactable. There's something in there for sure. There's some lights here. Green and red. Oh, there has to be something. Yeah. Oh, open turn on. Yeah, there must be something. But that's probably the valve. Let me go look. I just got a light in here. Yep. I can turn the valve now. Water's draining. Big developments. We're figuring something out. Oh, yeah. Wait, what does that screen say? Oh, we can go now around and up this. No signal. Check cable for connection. Oh, no way. It's just a loot room, dude. I was like, we're about to find a hunter. Dang it. It could be something still. technically. All right. Well, we found a a mini secret. Um, but yeah, sorry. Someone was asking if you can get a one strap bag for free. This one that I'm wearing right now is the new gear set bag. Um, and that's you can just get that in targeted loot. You don't have to do anything, you know, don't have to pay or do anything crazy. So, yes, you can. I'm going to put the other one back on then. Um, all right. Should we finally go to the safe room that we've had marked for 20 minutes? Yeah. It's so easy to get lost when there's a new world. There's so many things to do. I like how this area's got some real verticality. Got to climb up here. But the fact just knowing that there's hidden objectives just, you know. Yeah. Um, what's up, Peter? Good to see you, man. Unwanted. I'm doing fantastic. It's launch day. How could I not be? How you doing? No, more apparel. So, this is cool. We can look at the New York side of the waterfront. That's the building where the side mission was at the ferry terminal somewhere down there. Cule. All right, I'm coming. Hey, we got Leo in the chat. What's going on, man? Very good to see you. Happy launch day. I hope things weren't too chaotic over at the studio. Purple beanie. How'd you get that bag? It's in the store, Michael. Under the the fail bundle. All right, safe room. Think there'll be anyone in here? No one's as far along as we are yet. A hunter? Don't say that. Oh, we can use Shay Tech to open this. Oh, it's just loot detected. I thought there was going to be something in there. There's a comm though. This is more than a safe house. More than a safe house? Less than a settlement. Oh, wait. What are you doing here? The Rikers were helping them rebuild. You don't act like the rest of them. Search drive. I think that gives you bounty stuff. That's really my role in the family. Shake cases unlocked. Activision. Uhhuh. Project added. Yeah. It just gives you all the like pings and stuff. There's so many underground locations. Look at that. Medics and tech experts. We keep the machines working while the locals from the shadows and make the tough calls. Yeah, we're supposed to be new project. Brooklyn Heights Liberation gives you a bounty for community. We're supposed to build community. I don't think everyone read the last page of the pledge. We're the same like that. Excuse me. Community. The only reason we commit crimes is the law doesn't support our community. Oh, I unlocked the Nimble holster on the pass. Forgot a Riker lock box. I like that respect. It's way easier than politics. Just be respectful and we'll get along. Don't blow smoke up my ass and I won't have to smoke yours. We need to secure. Interesting that the comm says they're working together, but now they're attacking the bridge. I wonder what happened. All right, let's get over to this next mission. So, we have one more side mission and two main missions to go. Oh yeah, we're going out there. Just super long drops. Bridge Park Pier record. Let's do it. At the pier, we need to secure this defensive position. Hostiles detected with friendly security clearance. What does that mean with friendly security clearance? They're friendlies. Don't shoot out. The rat queen. I will not let her down or give up our new toys. The rat queen. Who is the rat? This is the question. Electronic device detected. Sweep for hostiles. Is there a collectible bay? Yeah. And also have my backpacks. Wait, I don't see it. I hear it. Oh, okay. I thought you you already found it. No. Portable electronic device detector. Is that what you meant? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's through that door, but maybe we can get it later. Walker. There's another one over here, too. Through the wall. Active launcher detected. I'll grab it after. Oh, rockets. Those don't feel good. Ow. I got a sniper back there, too. All right, follow the wires. Oh my god, it got me mid cover. Move. Oh god. All right. I don't have a hive. I should probably swap back to that. Careful. Launcher disabled. Oh, you got that thing. There's another generator. Serious. More coming this way. I don't know if I want to swap off the smart cover to back my hive or not. immediate medical assistance. Oh, okay. Maybe I do. Good lord. And the snipers are brutal. By the way, folks, again, still over a thousand people watching is insane. Thank you for being here. We're also only 30 likes away from 1,000 likes. I think that would be the first time we would ever hit 1,000 likes on the stream, which would be insane. If you have not yet and you want to help out, but once again, thank you for spending your launch day hanging out with me. It really means a lot. Oh yeah, here's the com back here. Danveridge. I thought you could disable their automated defenses. We attacked their power source. Their defenses go down, but hilos and reinforcements, those aren't on the bridges network. We want them to end. Need to keep new agents from coming to the raid. Huh. Whoever Danvers is is supplying both the cleaners and them. So, that's probably going to be the main boss in the final mission, I would think. Hostiles. Thank you, Malt Ninja. That's very kind of you to say. What LMG is that? Is the blue screen exotic LMG? We got another turret. I like how I just said I need to swap off a smart cover and yet I didn't do it. I got you. Agent, please. Am I dumb? I was trying to follow the wire. Sending the marauder. Oh, did you say the drone's coming? Sending the marauder. Yep, there it is. That's our friendly drone. That's tight. Oh, but it's still shooting us. to battle in the sky. Launcher disabled. Blew up the launcher. Nice. Dude, this marauder's OP. Something's going to take it out, I'm sure. He can show up and win all of our fights for us. Well, it has weak points on agent. Do you hear that? You messed up, man. You're not supposed to shoot it. Points were actually weak. I guarantee someone's going to hack it at some point and then we have to fight it. I' I'd put five bucks on that. Electric hazard detected. Electric. Move up one panel at a time, maybe. Yeah, that's so OP. We just have a launcher or a marauder drone on our set. Yeah, until it hurts you. Did it? I think I think that was They still have their They still have their launchers that are not disabled yet. I think it shot you. There's one right to your right. Oh, yep. Intercept me. Rocket launcher disabled. I'm dead. I'm coming. I need to bring the marauder back while there's still something left to salvage. I'm sorry. Oh, it got damaged apparently. So, he's got to take it back. behind us. I just spawned out of that door. I'm not ready for it. We spawn camp until we can't Immediate medical assistance needed. Sweeper hostiles. Sweep for hostiles. Think we should sweep. Sweeping. Yeah. Uh, Loki, I am using four pieces of ongoing directive with the chest piece and the momento backpack and contractor's gloves. Those things hurt. Yeah, they do. Launcher console detected. Launcher console. This one's got to take more. I'm going to take more stuff. I've got really good sideline up here for damage, though. If you want to focus on that, you can mow him down. Oh, I have to hack it or something. Yeah, it's like the sit in the area thing. Activating protocol on launcher. I got I got overwatch on you. Of course, my smart cover is going to run out right as they spawn, though. Get out of cover, fools. Proto successful launcher. Careful. God damn it. Kill that agent and get the launcher back on. Another launcher. How many launchers these guys got? It's on the far side. Activating takeover protocol on launcher. Oh, I just watched that happen. Oh, it hit me, too. There is no stopping these things. My goodness. I wasn't standing in it cuz I was spawning behind me. Additional hostile% complete. Oh, shoot. I'll crawl towards you. There's like no place to hide in this in this room here. Protocol successful. Almost there. Please. Thank you, sir. By the way, folks, thank you so much for getting us past a thousand likes. That is insane. Like I said, I think that is the most likes we've ever had on the stream. That's amazing. Oh. Where did we finally get through? Dude, that one was uh that one was tough. The hotel and the museum pass the collapsed DZ. Get back to the bridge. That was a good mission. Past the collapsed DZ. What? The art museum. Hunt down the rat queen. All right. Good lord, there's like four bosses listed. Um, discover main mission. Ah, here we go. I don't know why I'm doing this. I got accommodation for that. You should check yours. Yeah, but how did I become your apprentice? You're curious and I like working with you. I've got three. And I'm the only one who didn't say no. Right. Frankly, there was no one else to ask. It's really just you, Mark, and Bishop that we trust right now. And your daughter, we trust her, of course. But six is a little young for an arc welder, don't you think? Fair enough. Need to check my journey as well. I got three commenations. February again. Not if we have power. Okay. So, where do we start? Oh, and I've unlocked some passive mods now. The local solar station at the bridge. Now, we need to work on building remote power stations to supply the rest of so many of them. You're rebuilding the grid. Pretty much just an offrid grid that plugs into the original grid. So, the build and fire protection from elites. That's pretty good. Plants normally, but we keep having blackout. So, I'd rather not rely on I'm going to do these three. No matter how clean it's supposed to be. Oh, I need to go per slot. Yeah. Check your modifiers, too, if you haven't. I have none. You have none. I'm surprised. I would have thought through the journey you got some. That's where they come from. So much stuff on a new season day. Season pass. Journey. Um, all right. I'm going to fast draw back to the bridge really quick. I'm going to take another 60 seconds. Let me We'll post up again with the radio. Oh, we'll put it in front of the uh front of the movie screen. View upgrade. [Music] Um, all right, chat. Give me another 60 seconds to use the bathroom, and when I get back, we will do the next main mission. I didn't turn my mic off. Sorry. Easy money. Oh, we got the bell, boys. All aboard the Polar Express. Oh yeah, this guy took off his momento. trap. All right. Who started the ruckus this time? N I forgot to play music. I'm sorry if that was a less fun break, chat. Yeah, your build's so sick. Really? I think your build is sick. Six random pieces. Is that what we were going for? Oh, not the six random Oh, dude. I never I never put momento back on. Good lord. How long were you all going to let me go without momento? That's why that mission was so tough because I had no I had no damage. Good lord. I blame whoever it was that asked me about the onestrap backpack. That's the only reason I equipped that. All right, Daniel. Daniel tried to tell you for a while. Daniel, I'm sorry I missed the message. Okay. Um, shall we do main mission number two? Yep. Let's hit it. I'm really curious to see how this is. I like the last one. See what we get. Don't worry, Daniel. I got you. The art museum out here. So, we are We're right next to a dark zone. That's cool. Or is this in a dark zone? I can't tell. What are you do? What? What are you doing on my screen? You were just floating up there just falling infinitely. The queen is hiding out in the museum. Hiding out in the museum. Oh, she is. Huh? Is that so? Not of us agents have anything to say about it. This is cool. All right, let's get it. You um sir, you can't park there. Sir, you're you're actively wasting what little water we have left on this earth in the apocalypse. All right, here we go. All right. Maybe now that I have momento, I'm fine to keep smart cover. I don't know. I'm really torn on if I should. Oh, more turrets. Come on, man. We're never escaping these things. Oh, and these ones are like actual gun turrets. We're in the DZ. True. They're coming up to your right. I don't see the weak point for it. I don't know if there is right now. Oh, you can just shoot it. No, no, you can't. Sorry. I thought I was getting damage numbers, but that was bleed from the ad. There has to be another way in. There should be a Okay, we just got to go around. I'm coming to you. Oh, there's a subway. What happens on the map? Oh, you see the building? Okay. It's more like a quiz nose. Not like a subway, but Okay. This is fantastic comedic relief though for the stream. I'm normally never this entertaining. Yeah, right. New apparel screwdriver. It's got to be something that looked kind of Oh, thank you, Mr. Nobody. I honestly forgot that I I mean, I knew it was posting today. I forgot that it was already out. Uh, thanks very much. I debated whether or not I wanted to post it cuz obviously I don't put my face on a lot of stuff, but I figured why not. So, glad you liked it. God damn it. It's It might not be as relevant now as it was a few weeks ago because the DLC's out and you have questions to a lot of those answers. I or answers to a lot of those questions that I asked, but I figured it was still worth posting. I can't see nothing. Hostile radio intercepted. Zoom said DZ three times in the mirror. Maybe we'll get one. Oh, there's a box here. That's a good strat actually. Hang on. We got a box. I don't know if that opened something. Maybe it opened this. What? Just mysterious. I think it might have been that just that little room. All right, agent. Find your way into the exhibition. Got a feeling it's going to be interesting. He's got a feeling it's going to be interesting. I don't like the sound of that. Just melee him full speed. There should be an exotic where if you're sprinting, your melee damage is increased by like 5 million. Doesn't work in PvP. Only PvE, but just get to run up and smack somebody. This is Oh god, I knew it and I walked into it anyway. What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] below us. It's one [\u00a0__\u00a0] Can't see you. Did we secure it? Maybe. Oh, another box. I'm following the wire this time. Oh, it goes in here to the next. Oh, maybe that's what we had to do. Wow, you progressed us. Yo, these guys are tanky. Laying into them with expertise 28 and he's still just eating it. You think this is something? That's the other side where we came. There it is. Yeah, that's where we ran through first. Oh, I knew that for sure. I know what's going on. All right, Gregory. I am on Xbox Series X. We got more of these lights back here. Got a Streamline drop. Put on the carbine for Heartbreaker. Like it quite a bit. Nice. Yeah, I need to if I see Streamline, I need to save it in my library. By the way, likes people with still 950 people hanging out. Thank you once again for being here. How do we get this thing open? The door by pushing it. I don't know. Is there another one? Yeah, they shoot the lock from the other window. Oh, fancy. Oh, what is that? What? Oh, silver bracelet. There's something dropped with the pants and I've never seen that symbol before. It's like new drop. By the way, I need to do my shade requisition. Hostile turrets detected. Get my free season pass to reach the exhibition. Oh, turrets just chilling out there. By the way, Unseen Gamer, join up to Rogue Studios. Thank you so much, my friend. I appreciate that greatly. Welcome to corner. Turret disabled. Nice. Additional turret still online. Yeah, be sure to join our Discord server if you haven't. You'll get exclusive access over there for being a member if you link up your YouTube account. We have a good time. This morning was fun. Everybody was freaking out about servers being like 12 minutes late or whatever they were. Postman knows he was there. I was as late as I was. popping all my buffs. There's a lot of ads up here. Uh, Bing Bong. I'm not sure yet if there are any leads on it. There is a Division 2 Secrets Discord. They're usually like the first people to find it, so I recommend joining in there if you want a live update. Um, I'm pretty much out of the loop on everything this morning. I jumped on here as soon as the servers went live and I started streaming and that's that's all I know. I've not been online. Oh, now we're getting fancy. Oh, look at that. Wow, that's cool. Oh, that is sick. Here they come with a gas mask on there. I don't know why I do this to myself. Just run right up in the middle. I know. I just start meleeing them. I don't know why. Just fun. You're on the Daisy Instincts. Oh, I don't even know. Can you melee in that game? Boss Vinnie go instead of Van Go. I like it. These gloves are so nice. These clothes. You mean your outfit or what? for the exotic. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. These I thought you were like, \"These clothes are so nice.\" I'm like, \"Okay, we got to get out of the gun.\" We are lighting these guys up. Yeah, my [\u00a0__\u00a0] fit sick. All right. The statue is actually cool. Yeah, this room is tight. That's a cool That's a cool prop. Jacket. What is this used for? What are your thoughts on the DLC so far, Rogue? I'm enjoying it. I mean, I think I said earlier, as long as you go in with the right expectations that this is not going to last you days and days to complete. I mean, we're probably I would guess 75% of the way through the main content after a few hours. We still have one more main mission to do after this and whatever else there might be. But everything's been fun so far. We've ran into minimal bugs. Pretty much no major bugs, which is really solid. Um, so yeah, this there's something in here. This door opens up somehow. H. Let me see if I can find the password. It's not a huge deal if we don't do it. I'm sure we'll end up replaying these missions stuff. I don't see any obvious wire additions detected. Oh, it's staff only. We're not staff. That's the problem. We got to go through and become staff at the museum. King says, \"I think it's worth for sure.\" Yeah. I mean, for 15 bucks, you get uh three main missions, four re replayable side missions, which have all been really fun. I mean, we did all four. They were all pretty well scripted and well done. I spent 1999. Did I buy the wrong one? 1999. What did you get? Cuz the the standard is 15 and then the deluxe is 25. Oh, these are cool. I don't know what you spent 20 on though. More turrets. Not again. Oh, the way points are behind the things that move. Wait, what's moving? Look on the wall where you had to shoot the weak points. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, I'm actually impressed with the difficulty. I thought that because we got to keep our expertise levels and everything that this would be a complete pushover. And I mean, it's not like the most difficult thing in the world, but they're finding pretty unique ways to up the challenge a little bit. The boss at the end of the first main mission was fun. I'm really interested to see what we're going to find at the end of this one. the museum. You need to find the rat queen. Yeah, that was cool with the weak points being back there. Postman spent 75. Yeah, he might have gotten ripped off, man. He's like, I bought I bought a copy on eBay. Somebody was selling it. I couldn't find the actual like just the Brooklyn one. So, what did you buy? Like the the one that had like New York again, but I Oh, really? I already have. It was in the store. I got it like last night at like 3:30 in the morning. Oh, maybe cuz they went up in in different orders cuz I got mine this morning when I woke up. Oh, that's annoying. I just want to make sure it was all downloaded last night. And the only one I seen in the store, Xbox store was it was 1999 for the the bundle. Yeah. Warlords and the Brooklyn. Well, now you have Warlords in New York twice. Yeah. This outdoor spot was cool. The statues All right. Portable device detected. Portable device. Echo detected nearby. Oh, and an echo. Hopefully, it will give us some intel on the queen and what they're really doing here. I agree, Theo. What are they really doing here? I'm going to listen to this really quick before going home. This is terrible. Okay, try this one. Oh, shoot. Not that one. Here, try this. This is ridiculous. How many more of these do we have to do? Just one more. I hope it Oh, this is actually kind of nice. Yeah, this works. H they're doing something with like voice modulation and deep fakes because we saw in that first cut scene that they did the same thing. All right, we'll see what's see what awaits us. I think I got us the loot room back here. Oh yeah, here's the echo. I'll wait if you want to see it. Echo nearby. Okay, I'm just uh No, you're good. Um, Bing Bonga, I've heard there's some issues with people redeeming it. I'm afraid I don't have any good solutions for you at the moment. I don't know what's going on with that. They told me that it was pretty much infinitely usable once per Ubisoft account. So, if that's not the case or something's going on with it, I'm not 100% sure at this time what the workound might be. Um, but if I get any further info, I'll let you know. There's a chance there's just so many people trying to use it right now that it's like overloading. Um, but again, I I just I'm not 100% sure. [Music] Um, R6, yeah, I appreciate it very much. Thank you for watching the stuff. But yeah, it's not something that I I care to wait into personally. I'm more focused on doing what I enjoy here at the channel and trying to make good videos. Okay. I put modifiers on though. Oh, cool. Yeah, some of them seem good. This one gives me crit damage and shing from elites. I didn't realize I had them on cuz I had a hold. Yeah, they changed it to a hold. Yeah. Whenever you're ready, we can watch this echo. Oh, yep. Nice. Um, and unseen. Thank you very much for You got to come back this way. Thank you very much for hanging out, man. For for becoming a member. I appreciate it. Are we sure about this? Sarah's right. Women don't tend to commit suicide by handgun. They like to leave a pretty corpse. We like to avoid slow, painful deaths. Self-inflicted gutshot is painful and slow. You're right. This is just so we have variation. We don't have much time to get through the list and then put the Wait, so that lady that was in the last location, you want to die at Pier three, right? Yeah. Theo has memories there. I would like to destroy those memories. The [\u00a0__\u00a0] Rude. The rat queen is Sarah. Agent, do not eliminate the rat queen. Anna, I'm thinking eliminate. Apprehend the target. I need to know why. I need to interrogate her. What the hell is she thinking? [\u00a0__\u00a0] All right, you tas her. I'll tackle her. But is it is she actually it or are they just doing more of the deep fake stuff? Agent, please. I have to understand why she would do this to simulation. This is confusing. All right, let's go. Oh, what is this? Are you ready to bow before your queen? Possibly. I don't know. Hunter smoke, dude. Look at on the screens, too. She's walking down. They put some production value into the bosses on this DLC. I like it. Is there a turret over there? Oh, no. He's just mounted up on the shield. Got to be more careful. biometric signature target located on the roof. On the roof? How do you think I'm going to get up to the roof? Hostile reinforcements. Big guy coming over here. Boss got one on me too. I broke his shield and everything. Yeah, I had to take this guy down with the shield. Zipping him right more ads. Yep. Agent, get to the roof. I need to talk to Sarah. Get to the roof. I need to know why she would do this. But would she rarely do that? Well, that's what I'm saying. Like, how do you not know it's just another in the rac queen? We trust dogs eat pigs. All right, here we go. more loot. Okay. Oh, look at this. Kill any. No, but I'm going to kill you. Um, she's immune. Really? Enemy shields. way the writers could make a shield like that for Sarah. As long as Oh, it's like the one that Chimera had in I don't think you played it, but in one of the manhunts on the roof so we can knock out her shield. There's an EMP. Okay, I'm going back there. Serious. Wow. I got sniped. I think I disabled it though. Careful. Just snip it. I'll crawl over to you. I really should put on my hive again. He's still immune. Oh, there's another thing we have to go do. She's immune from everything else, too. Where's Oh, it's in the middle. I'll go for it. Knocked everything offline. Oh, including the hood. We're getting the recruiter thing in here. That was cool. Yeah. Come back here. She's still immune from like half of my shots. I don't know why. More generators. I'm hitting them if you've got aggro. Yeah, I got I got a As soon as they break my armor though, they're all going to shoot at you cuz Yeah, that's good. Yeah, people who are experiencing missing items in their stash, it shouldn't be permanent. It's just a visual thing. If you relog or travel to somewhere and come back or just give it a little bit, it should be there. This is what I've heard. I'm going to go hit it again. Okay. So, it's infinite spawns if we don't. Yeah. Okay. I'm about to hit it right now. Or you got it. I'll put up smart cover and we should just try and lay into her as much as possible. I don't know if it's healthgated or if it's just time based. Go. Now's your chance. Get serious [Music] detected. All [Music] right, I'm coming up. Oh, got her. Did we not Did we kill her? We were supposed to apprehend her. Oh, tough. I mean, I don't We didn't have a choice. dropped me exotic. She meant to die. You've been getting a bunch of exotics. I want to get that new one. Apparently, it's from the last mission is what they said on stream. That was an intense little boss arena there. Agent, we need to locate Danvers and end the Cleaner Riker collab. I can't believe Sarah's alive. I need to know why she would do this. She's alive. What? We just killed her. She's laying right here. Hermes dropping in with the 20. Oh, vital signs are acceptable. Uh, don't want to get spoiled. Excited to hop on later. Thank you very much for the 20, man. I appreciate it. I hope you enjoy playing for yourself when you get in there. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, they got people repelling down to revive and everything. Okay. The question is why are they doing all this? Why? Why? Why? Um Josh, my crit stats are 44 103. Uh Nocturnal, you can run through the new stuff on any difficulty. Like you're not stuck to just um just story. Report to the bridge. Side mission. Leo's going to be pissed. Nice to see you. Pushing. Don't be such a baby. That hurts. Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't have punched a wall. Better a wall than Sarah's face. She deserves it. Ow. You're fine. It's not broken. You don't even need a bandage. What'd she tell you? Danver is the one running the show. And where does he run the show from? Richard Danver's last known location. Army terminal. Status unknown. Thanks, Anna. You're welcome. Glasses. Agent, this is probably a trap. We don't know much about him, and I have no idea what you'll be walking into. But we do have an ID and a location. If we want this to end, you need to take out Dan, please. It's got to be us. Easy. Agent, get your gear and report to Belf Transpo. If we can trust the rat queen, Denver should be at the army terminal. Question is why? Why are they doing all this? Investigate the army terminal. So, from what I heard when I was over at Massive, there was a lot of uh some of the Bucharest people who were there who I talked to were like, \"Yeah, the only thing I've worked on for this DLC is the last mission.\" Like apparently the last mission is is something. So I'm excited to see what's in there. Was it worth the fiveyear wait? I don't think that's necessarily a fair thing to say because they have not been working on this for 5 years. There was a good year and a half there where we had no updates or no team while they were trying to rebuild things. Um for the resources that they have, I think this is pretty fun. It's cool. No view upgrade. Are there any safe houses in Brooklyn? Yeah, there's one per name zone. So, we got the one in Brooklyn Heights. We still need to find the one in Dumbo. Oh, we can go up on the roof now. And there's a collectible. Oh, thank God. Don't you ever do something that stupid again. I promise we're done. Sure, we are. I made a deal with Kener. We fake our deaths and I retire from field work. I'm here with you and the baby. Sure. What? When you get bored, what will you do? I won't get bored. Once the baby comes, you won't be bored. But in the meantime, this bun's not done baking in the oven. And you're not good without the project. I've always wanted to get into painting plastic minis. Yeah, just one problem. You don't have any minis. We have a 3D printer. I could design and print my own minis. Could make ones of us fighting a dragon. Okay. And where are you going to get the paint to paint them? We can make some existed before hobby shops. Yeah. Beetles to make. What? Carmine red painted beetles. They still use it for food dye and lipstick. So yeah, that red lipstick. That was a long comp. Um I was just clearing out my cashes. You about ready? Same. Yeah. Okay. Trash all this stuff. I'm going to swap to revive hive and we're going to go do the final mission. Uh revive that. Um, hidden hero. It should not be deleted. It might just be a visual bug. Try logging out and back into the game or traveling to like New York and back to DC or just give it some time. It should repopulate. Some people have been seeing that, but it's from what I've heard, it's only a visual thing. No worries, Prawons. I appreciate you uh hanging and watching. Still have 900 people here hanging out, which is amazing. Again, thank you all for spending launch day with me. Let me know when you're good. Buying the law backpack. Oh, hell yeah. You just have to wear it with a something that hides your vest. That's the only way the one straps work. I mean, you can still It has a two-strap version, but otherwise it has to be. You got it, Roger. That's cool. Gray look. All right, I'm ready. Okay. Um, putting together a new fit for the final mission. Um, do that. Well, no. I should just go back and write what I was All right, final mission. Is everybody ready? Like some stuff's about to go down. We will find out. Here we go. Feel like we're pulling up to a raid. Oh, this is cool. Oh, the the boat's leaving us. Didn't need them anymore. All right, let's see what goes down. You ready? Yeah. I was looking for the backpack. Couldn't find out. Oh, it's in the uh If you go to your apparel menu and figure out what the hell he's beening, it's down on that one. There's a backpack slot. Oh, there you go. Look at that. One strap. One shirt. One shirt. All right. Time to find out who Danver is. Hostiles detected. Cleaners. Vital signs critical. Ouch. Ouch. What's up, Emanuel? Yes, I am. It's been pretty fun. And we're close to the end here. At least from my understanding. This should be the last main mission. Okay. I'm on my villain arc. Destroy the supply. There's a weak point up above you. Got one of them. Weak point destroyed. Weak point destroyed. Weak point destroyed. Thank you, Anna. Destroyed. Hey, I think we destroyed a weak point. I think we got it. Structural damage to purple flame containment system detected. Explosion risk. Explosion risk. Get down low. Hermes with the 10 gifted. Dude, thank you so much again. I thought you were getting out of here for spoilers, man. Don't Don't ruin it for yourself. electronic. But thank you very much. I appreciate it. If any of you 10 people are here in the chat, please give him a thank you. His deep fakes are perfect. He is highly creative and very good at managing his team without getting angry. However, I am concerned with how attached he is getting to Violet. There may be a liability there. He doesn't seem to be fully attached to reality. Wasn't Violet the dog? the Robo-Dog with the 18month member message as well. Okay, now I'm done hopping on Brooklyn as soon as I get home. Do it, man. Do it. Thank you for being a member for 18 months. Thank you for the gifteds, everything. You know, I appreciate it greatly, dude. He's on site. All right. Warning. Active turrets detected. Generator located nearby. Generator located nearby. Turret disabled. Addition. Oh. They lobbed a grenade on me right before right before he got it. That building blew up. more hostiles detected. Um, Bodie Bear, Body Bear, hope I'm saying that right. If you have not figured it out yet, you can lure him into the gas valves and if you shoot them, they create like a big explosion and it takes a ton of his armor. That's like the mechanic of the fight. So, it's kind of to your benefit that he rushes you because you can very easily lead him into those explosions. So, I would try doing that. Stay on the move and lead him into those pipes so you can shoot. Agent adds Yeah, that's totally fair. Helios trying to trying to make the the new stuff last as long as possible. Glad you're enjoying it, though. It's been very fun. I agree. I'm liking the location for this last mission. It's got cool lighting and and uh combat arenas here. You're clear to Enter and find the target. Clear. Enter. Lock down initiated. Oh, agent, you're going to have to find another way out. You can't go back the way you came. Tough. Oh, really? Don't worry, I know how to hack these. Perfect. Oh. What the hell are they doing here? They're taking orders from Dan. What the hell are they doing here? He's taking orders from Danver. So, it's all they've been behind it. That explains a few things. Fly dog. You slime mother. How do we disable this one? Or do we not? I think this is just Yeah, this is all just a black tusk base. Oh my god. Agent, find a way to unlock that door. Oh, there's there's about to be some some revelations here. I can feel it. This is actually perfect that I'm rocking blue screen then for all the robotics. EMP them all. Someone said he stumbled upon a hunter puzzle and got rocked. People are finding him then. Oh, there's another comm here. Sarah is driven and full of rage. We can use that to our advantage. She can use that to our advantage. Faking her death was really her idea. Grant was happy to help, but it was really her vision. She wanted to do the most damage possible. While Grant may be disconnected from reality, Sarah might be too connected. Her pain is palpable and her capacity to lie is dangerous. I would not recommend working with her beyond our mission here in Brooklyn. H okay. But the Danverse guys related to agent John Danverse who was tortured by BTSU Galveston in an echo. I don't remember that. But it said just in that com that his name was Richard Danver. So I don't know. I assume we're about to find out pretty soon. All right. Where do we have to go? Override lockdown. Oh, there's a thing here. Oh, look what you just open this thing on the wall. Wait, it's a shade watch thing. What is happening here? [Music] Investigate the terminal. We're about to learn some [\u00a0__\u00a0] dude. I can feel it. Door status update unlocked. You go first. Door unlocked. Signature detected. Perfect. What's SMR? What the hell is an SMR signature? Oh, just a small modular reactor. Nuclear. Nuclear reactor. All right, this is it. We're going to nuke ourselves. That's how the Division 2 ends. Um, yeah, it is Helios. This is the third main mission. If anybody doesn't want to watch for spoilers, I fully understand. I think we're about to get into the This could solve our power with commission. We need a stable source of power. Agent sec. Oh, this could be a big old power source. You heard the hostile derail. Got him. Agent. Oh, we got floor is lava again. Countdown. Shoot. I did not get off of it. What do we have to do? Stabilize the power grid. Okay. I've got a keyboard here and a wall panel. Oh, I just add control. Okay. The power still unstable. There must be another short somewhere. Keep looking, agent. By you. By you. I'll get it once this sh Oh, they're not hit by it. That's annoying. Screw the room. The room agent needs assistance. Agent, you're clear. Keep going. We need to find Danvers and figure out what the hell the Black Tusk are up to. Whatever it is, it's going to be big. Yeah. Well, they want to get into the bridge settlement. So maybe they're trying to steal that marauder. Agent, you're a good soldier. You should join us. You should join us. be on the right side of history. Want to join the black to imagine if DC gets n them. We're almost ready to deploy. Ready to deploy? What? Dude, imagine we actually don't get to explore Brooklyn and just gets nuke. This is a cool location, though. Subvert the operation. Oh, hostiles detected. Agent, we got a nuclear Reactor powering something. Powering something. That's always a good sign. Has Theo shown you what's in the box yet? You trust him so much you're willing to die for him. But do you even have a clue what he bunker of his? What is going on? Press the button. Complete multiple blocks. [Music] Oh, shoot. Is it Leslie? That's annoying. Apparently, the gameplay audio is out of sync. All right. Well, I'll wrap up this main mission and then we'll probably call the stream there then since we will have done all the main content. I apologize to anyone listening. The audios apparently out of sync now. I thought I'd maybe hopefully fix that issue, but I guess not. That's annoying. I'll turn down the game volume slightly so it's a little bit less annoying. I don't know if people actually want that or not. It's a frustrating issue, that's for sure. All right, we got Warhounds. Oh, and these are like straight up all the different kinds of warhounds. Oh, he's in town while I'm laying into him. That's the same sparkles one. Immediate medical assistance needed. I'm excited to see Enji uncover this DLC. Yeah, you and me both. He'll explain everything that's going on. Warhound activated. Yep, we got the fire guys now. Download complete. Agent, disable any remaining workst. Disable the workstations. What's up, Aikido? if restarting your streamer device. Yeah, I could start a new stream and it would fix it. But since we're on the last mission, I think I'm just going to wrap this up and then we'll probably call the stream there cuz that's the majority of what I wanted to stream was the the main content and story. So again, I apologize to everybody that the uh the audio sync issue was there. I know that's annoying to listen to, but we're just going to finish this last mission. Oh, I didn't even see that. Work station destroyed. Good call. I'm here. I've analyzed the intel you recovered. Not Not only are the black test developing new equipment here with the purple flame, but they're shipping most of it out of state. There's another file here that's still encrypted. Shipping most of it out of state to division three out of question mark. Imagine that' be crazy. But it's still another like three years away. Dude, what on earth is going on here? It looks like something broke through the ceiling. Uh, Ako, I'm hope you're I'm saying your name correctly, but thank you very much for the kind words. I appreciate it. But NGN is a legend as well. He's the best. Oh my god. Another fire warhead. They don't stand a chance against our expertise levels. Get on that with the scientist. Agent, get to the roof. Get ready for liftoff. I think you've been surrounded by good people for so long, you've forgotten what a snake looks like near the rooftop. Sounds good, Souy. I appreciate it. I will absolutely check that out uh later today. Oh yeah, more apparel. Electrical hazard detected. Oh, look at this. Good lord. I need to go back through the schematics. The cables must be connected to one of these. So, we just found like a blacktus research lab out here. I'm sorry, Postman. Had the audio not desync, I might have gone longer. And I'd hoped that maybe I'd fixed it with something I did recently, but I guess I did not. Nope. I didn't think there'd be enemies in this part. Oh, there's a mini tank over here. [Music] What is lifting off? Almost. Just need to do a few safety checks and we're ready to go. Agent, you need to get to the roof. If they lift off, we'll lose. Oh, this is not the way to go. Do I got to go all the way around back to you? Yeah. What on earth? There we go. Load room. I think we're fine with that. Can't let them lift off. They just have a a fighter jet coming in. That'd be hilarious. Yeah, this is What just happened to my view there? Okay, seriously, what the hell? Is your camera really zoomed in? Oh, there it was just on that platform for some reason. All right. Again, everybody, I can talk. Everyone, apologies for the audio desync. We're just going to finish this main mission, but thank you for still hanging out in spite of it. We still have 850 people, which is amazing. Cleared for liftoff. Excellent. Route is clear. We should reach the target in 15 minutes. The target. What the hell? What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] are we going to do about that? No. Dude. Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] Is huge. Okay, we have to stop a Zeppelin. That's That's doable. That's something we can do for sure. I can throw my secret mine at it. Look at that thing, dude. This high techch. The door just opened up. Oh, there's a cannon coming out. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Oh my god, that's an understatement. The bottom's opening up. I'm just watching at this point. I'm like, \"Yeah, this is cool.\" Oh, it's like razor backs on the bottom. Oh my. What the hell? Drown detected. Lock in. Okay, lock in. I wish I would have brought some backup now. Can we have that little marauder that Theo had show up? Dude, what on earth? What are we even supposed to be doing? Just securing the area. Okay, that said, this is some Avengers Hydra type [\u00a0__\u00a0] Oh my goodness. That's fun. Yeah, I wish I had put on like a jammer pulse now. Although actually the blue screen works pretty well against it. I'm coming. What do we even do against this thing? I can see now why so many people worked on this last mission. Good lord. We got some missiles. Air missiles. Come and do the sands. It's on the move. I'm getting the laptop. accessing surface to air missiles. 170 m. A laser marauder. Oh, yep. It's Yeah, on the way. Oh, still got rockets though. I'm cooked. I'm getting resed. Agent, re-engage the hack. Agent. Yeah, Texo, the audio is desynced. My apologies. It's an issue with the stream. Uh, we're just going to finish up this last mission though and then probably call it there. So, not too much longer, but I do apologize about that. on the move. The chat's blowing up saying, \"Is this a breakpoint raid? Looks awesome. This is peak.\" That's pretty cool. Oh, it's flying away. It's not even here anymore. Come and do the Sam security system. We got a small window in the I feel like I'm in Mission Impossible. Have a small window to hit the blimp. Otherwise, we're all dead. This would have been a crazy raid. True. Yo, look. It's just flying away over there. We need to take out the same. Take out the rogues. Are we the rogues? Sam online. Console is unlocked and ready. to target and launch. Come on, agent. We have a minute to stop it. Is there a another panel in here? Mhm. Oh, cut scene. maneuvers. Oh, this is where all the budget went. Dang, dude. Holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] Of course, we saved you. You saved us. You killed Danver. [\u00a0__\u00a0] can burn in hell. Intel. Oh, look at here on this one. Sit, boy. Sit. That's funny. Oh, another cut scene. Oh, they didn't suspect anything. They leave rogue tech lying around everywhere. No one's going to miss a box or two. Lucky us. the other thing. No way. Now we'll be disappointed. Oh, there's nothing I can do. There's only one key to the vault where they keep the Amherst printer. That key is on a chain around Theo's neck. Only person who might be able to get it is Moral. Can you recruit her? No. She loves him too much to betray him. We just have to be patient. Last time we went out of town, he gave the key to Candle. Much easier to get the key off the dock than an agent. Well, let's give him a reason to get out of town. What? They want Amherst printer. They're going to make another virus. Huh. Well, GG's. That's Battle for Brooklyn. There's still another side mission to do. Report to the bridge. What are we thinking, chat? That was insane. Just blew up a black tusk blimp. Good lord. Lunar said, \"When I saw the blimp, I could not believe it.\" Meet Theo inside the bridge. Wait, unseen found footage. I think I just watched this, didn't I? Yeah, saw that. Okay. Meet him inside the bridge. Hey, you didn't tell her it was here. What the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is wrong with you, Theo? Show me. Remember, it's just a tool. It's only a weapon in the wrong hands. That [\u00a0__\u00a0] is going to get us killed. Be ridiculous. Oh, now you get to go in there. Told you I wanted it in there. See, nothing to be afraid of. You use this to make the eclipse virus. No, no, no. We don't do anything like that anymore. For now. Uh, we only use the printer for vaccines, meds, and research, or I'm out. The eclipse was research, not my research. We need this printer. With Sarah and the clinic gone, I need this printer. But the printer puts a target on our backs. No, it doesn't. And even if it did, there's always going to be a target. So, the printer makes us a slightly larger target. It's worth the risk. They came for the printer. Look, you left that key around my neck, and you never thought to tell me what it was protecting. You know what, Theo? [\u00a0__\u00a0] you. You put me and my family in danger again. And for what? You know what? Maybe you should stop pissing in Kell's eye and he'll stop trying to stand on your [\u00a0__\u00a0] neck. She has a point. We need pertasus vaccines. You bring them to me when you're done. Hoskins will get over it. She has to. We can't let the Black Tusk get their hands on the printer. They already have the bioreactor. I mean, what does she expect me to do? Hand this over to Manny at the White House. That is insane. No, with Candle here and the good she can do with it. This is the best place for the printer. H. All right, we're cooking up another virus to kill the world because why not? We are division the division. Uh well there you go people. That was battle for Brooklyn. Pretty wild ending with a zeppelin. Did not see that coming. Got our hunter mask to go after. So yeah, as far as the main story content, I believe that is about it. Uh, we've of course then got, like I just said, the hunters, all the other world content to find out. I still need to go and discover the rest of the map. But yeah, of course, you'll see in four and a half hours. Yeah. And that's why I was saying before, like, as long as you go in with the expectation that it's not as large as some of the other stuff we've gotten before, then I think it's it was pretty fun. But, um, I like that it was linear. We went through all the stuff in the same in the correct order. And the fact that they were blah I can talk. The fact that they were able to put all the beats one after another in the way that it was intended was cool. They did not claim it was 12 hours of total gameplay. They said the completing everything in the DLC would take six to 10 hours. Uh we are not done with everything in the DLC. We have eight hunters to go after their projects to go after. That is what they meant when they said all of the content in the DLC, but they said six to 10. They did not say 12. Yeah, folks. I think that was pretty much it. Again, also because the audio is desync at this point, I'm probably going to call the stream there. I'm going to grab some lunch. I'm pretty hungry. And get to work on the videos. Apparently, people have been sending me stuff for the hunter. So, we're going to look into that. Um, we've got I got to go farm the catalyst. We didn't get that from that one. Start doing some builds with Smart Cover. There's gonna be a bunch of stuff. So, yeah, that is probably gonna be about it. Martin, thank you. I appreciate you saying that. Your 24 hours aren't up, Postman. I think you might have been the only one who had put that expectation on me, and you didn't tell me beforehand. So, how was I supposed to know? Yeah, exactly, Daniel. Like I'm obviously rushing through this stuff pretty quickly, but if you're taking your time looking at everything, all that, it's going to take you longer as well. And like I said, I'm not done. I still got eight hunters to go after. There's projects from the safe houses, so I still have like half of the map to explore. And they also said from the start it's going to be a shorter shorter thing. Hey, we got Daniel from Bucharest in the chat as well. Hope you enjoyed it. Really fun watching you go through that last mission. Dude, that was insane. A blacktusk zeppelin was pretty much the last thing I could have possibly guessed that was going to happen there. That was a ton of fun, man. All three of those missions were were really cool. I like the locations. Uh the fact that the bosses had mechanics to them was fun. Good stuff, man. Good stuff. It was so cool to be able to see this, you know, a month ago. The improvements you guys made to the boss on the H5 refinery mission was awesome. So, awesome work on this, especially considering the, you know, lack of resources compared to prior expansions and stuff the Division has done. I think you guys put something pretty fun together here. Good stuff. You should feel proud. Thank you for saying that, Michael. Uh, new scout mission as well. Yeah, we got the scouts to go through. It's a big update. I mean, clearly we just did the huge chunk of it with the story here. But we got the scouts, we got gear to farm. I got to keep going through my season pass, the journey. So, clearly there's going to be a bunch of videos in the upcoming days, uh, folks. So, obviously keep an eye out for those. And yeah, it's probably going to be another like two weeks worth of videos out of all this. So, like I said, buckle in. Um, thank you though for making this stream pretty much the biggest stream ever on my channel. We had, let's see, I look here, over 1,200 people at one point. We have 1,200 likes. Um, absolutely incredible. So, thank you so much. It was really cool that we hit 100K a few weeks ago, right around the time this is happening. I launched kind of the rebrand last night if you noticed with the new banner and profile picture. So, it's been a pretty crazy two months leading up to this, including the massive trip and everything. So, it's been a lot, but I'm excited to keep going here and get going on all these videos to cover the stuff. So, stay tuned. Like I said, there's going to be tons of videos. Also, my interview with Yanick dropped like a few hours ago while I was live. If you want to check that out, that's up. Um, but yeah, Hunter Mask guides coming up, stuff on the catalyst, builds, everything. Stay tuned. Again, thank you all so much for making this what it was. That was incredible. Thank you to Postman again. I know you're still here for the 50 gifted. That was insane. And yeah, you all are the best. Like I said though, I am signing off for now, but I'll see you back soon in videos. Peace. [Music] [Music]"}, {"source": "YouTube: One Strap Backpacks Explained \u2013 The Division 2", "content": " Hello everyone and welcome on the release of Battle for Brooklyn DLC. I did a pre-recorded video about uh one strap backpacks because I knew they were coming to the game. I apologize in the video because it was pre-recorded and I don't like doing videos like that, but I was doing like a very long stream that ended up to be 31 hours and I just knew people were going to be asking the question about one strap backpack. So, we knew of one way at the time of getting one and I explained that in that video, but now there's free available and a lot of people asking about one strap backpack still and they asked me to remake the video. Now, it's not pre-recorded and we know all the information. So, you can see right here I'm wearing a one strap backpack. It's got a lot of attention in the streams. People asking how did they get that? So, I'm quickly going to show you the free onestrap backpacks that are currently in the game at the time of this recording. And then I'm going to show you exactly how they work because they don't work on all of your power items. They only work on certain power items. I'll also show you how you can change the color of them. These are all the questions I've been getting asked over the last few streams. So, we're covering them all in this video. So, let's go into the apparel menu first and show you two that you can get a hold of right now. You can see them here. Uh, you have to buy these. These are not for free. These two here have to be purchased. They are currently in the store. You can purchase them now. Again, at the time of recording this video, once the bundles go off though, you won't be able to get them unless they come around again. I'll show you those bundles in a moment. But you got the fail backpack, which is originally black. You see, I've got a dye on that, which is why it's changed color. And you got the death roll backpack as well. Now, both of these backpacks will appear as one strap depending on what you wear. And I'm going to show you that now. I'm going to show you how that works. So, I'm currently wearing this Red Panthers home jersey. It appears as one strap. Now, when you put the backpack on, you can see where it will appear as one strap and where it won't. If I switch to this bloody red shirt, it goes to two strap. So, it's not going to appear as a one strap on that. Same with the Stinger Hunter shirt. It's not going to appear as a one strap on that. It'll be a two strap. If I go to the Santa jacket, it will be a one strap. So, just put the backpack on. And once the backpack is put on, you can then look through all of your different apparel and see how it's going to appear on it. You'll see that with some it's two strap, with some it's one strap. So, it it's just how it works. They mentioned this when they said they were bringing on one strap backpacks back from the Division One. Uh they said it wouldn't work on everything, and this is what they mean. But you can see it works on quite a lot. I have seen some comments on the video saying that it works on nothing. Well, that's incorrect. It does work on quite a lot. There quite a lot of items I've got here where the one strap is working. Uh it's just how it is for now. I'm guessing it's like clipping issues or something like that. Um it's just not going to work on everything, but there's a lot that it does work on. So have a look through um see if you can find a cool outfit to go with your one strap and uh yeah, it'll appear as a one strap on quite a lot of the items. Not just these items here. There'll be some items in your outfits as well where it'll also appear as a one strap. On the cloak recruiter uniform, it appears as a one strap. So, plenty of these outfits it will do. Some it will still be two strap though as well. Again, it's just a case of equipping the backpack once you've bought it and seeing what it looks like as you go over all the different outfits that you've got. Now, how do you change the color of your backpacks? Well, when you go into your backpack menu here, you can on PC, it's the M button. I can press the M key and it brings up dyes. I'm able to then throw a dye onto it to change the color. And that's as easy as that. You can also like right click on it. Oh, I like that black one. That looks quite cool. We'll put that on. You can also go onto your build and you can right click and put on there providing they're not exotics. But don't do it that way. Just go into your backpacker power menu, select what backpack you want it to be showing from here, which one you want to wear, and then just go into dye from here. That's the best way to do it cuz then you can remove the dye as well if you want to. And there's no bugs or anything like that. I'm going to keep that color on. It looks pretty cool. I like that backpack. So that that's how that works. Now, if you want these two backpacks right now, as I said, they're in the store. You've got bundles. You can see the death roll uniform is this week's bundle here. You can buy your death roll backpack. There's a failout bundle as well. If you go into the failout bundle, that's where that backpack is. I'm not sure how much premium credits that cost. It might have been something like 700 credits, something like that. Or you can buy the whole outfit if you want to. You can just buy it individual at the same time. And it's the same with the death row uniform. This is a current bundle on offer this week on the store. You can just purchase the death roll backpack on its own. And I think that cost me might have been 675 premium credits. There's the whole bundle there. I I didn't like this that much. I didn't think the suit looked great, but I like the mask and I wanted the onestrap backpack. So, they are the current two one strap backpacks in the game where you can purchase. There is a free one though as well. So, once you get a hold of the new gear set which is measured assembly, this backpack is a one strap backpack. Now, this will work a little bit differently. Okay, so I'm going to throw this backpack on. You don't have to wear this backpack, but if your build has a exotic backpack, you're not going to be able to add it as an appearance mod. But what this does once you've got a hold of this, it will be added into your transmogs, which means if I just go out of here, go into my apparel, and remove backpack apparel, I can then throw on a build. So, let me throw on a build. There we go. This Eclipse build here. It doesn't have it doesn't have an exotic backpack. I can go right click, mod it, and I can change the look of this. I can go into my appearance slot here, and I'll find that new backpack from Measured Assembly in here. You can see it there. And I can add that as a transmog, which means it'll show. And that's a onestrap backpack. It doesn't look as cold as the others. Uh, but you can also dye this as well. you would have to use this menu to dye it from. Go into your dice slot. This does change color as well. So, you can make it look a lot better. So, if you just want the free one strap backpack for now, it is available. You only have to get that final measured backpack. Uh, not final measure, sorry, measured assembly backpack and it will go into your transmogs and that's how you equip it. Um, it just doesn't work with exotic backpacks. You can't add mods to exotic backpacks. You're not able to change their appearance this way. So on those builds you won't be able to do it. But any other build that doesn't have an exotic backpack, you can transmog it, you can get the one strap, you can change the color, and this one is free. So there your options right now for one strap backpacks. There are only three in the game. Um I much prefer that. That look quite cool with some of the uh different dyes that I had there, but I do much prefer the ones that you can purchase right now. I've been wearing the failout one for so long. It gives real Division one vibes. But I think I'm going to throw on this one. This looks pretty sick. The new death roll backpack that I just purchased. And that'll override anything that's in your build as well when you select it that way. Yeah, that looks real cool. I like the hunter watches on that. Look at that. That goes with the outfit. That's sick. But yeah, that's it. That's all I wanted to go over today. Again, I put that video out on the release of Battle for Brooklyn, and I wasn't able to show anything cuz it's pre-recorded. It was just information that I kind of knew. Uh hopefully this answers more of your questions, though, cuz there's been tons in chat. A few of you have have asked me to remake this video and and actually show you. So, uh yeah, I hope it's been helpful. I'm going to close off the video now with some plugs. So, if you do want to cross away, feel free. But thank you so much for watching today's video.

foundation of your gaming experience so let's go ahead and look at that really quick so this is what the map looks like as of right now year 6 season 3 and this of course is before the latest Brooklyn DLC now the new things added to the map uh we do have descent icons here so you can see that there are two desent icons now these are both entrance points to that game mode and we'll talk about that game mode here in a second we have the New Castle settlement that was added uh about two years ago actually wow that's crazy if we go up top we have our new game modes we have countdown we have Summit and then of course descent again right there you have Kinley College the Expeditions that are only open for a limited time for our main locations we have Coney Island we have the expansion uh to New York City Warlords of New York we also have the Pentagon location down here and then of course our two raids being dark hours Iron Horse and finally our incursion Paradise Lost now these are all PVE game modes and incursions and raids everything that I just showed you right there is PVE only uh the only PVP parts of the map we have our three dark zones so we have dark Zone East over here we have dark Zone South here at the bottom and we have dark Zone West over here in the corner now you would notice that dark Zone West has you know just the normal contaminated icon over there over its map and same with East however dark Zone South has this red contaminated icon with a knife right or a machete whichever one and this icon shows that it is invaded so when you hover over this map you can see in the uh right side of your screen it says invaded dark zone now what this means is this dark Zone only has Black Tusk associated with it that is the main difference the only other difference well actually there's two other differences so it's only Black Tusk the supply drops you will only have one per supply drop you know instead of the normal three and uh you will not have turrets near the checkpoints so there's actually three things that are different between the invaded dark Zone and the normal dark zone now way back in the day they called it the occupied dark Zone and things like that but they have changed the game so much since then this is invaded and it's because there are no turrets it's Black Tusk and you only get one supply drop instead of three now that one supply drop though will have all the bosses with it so where in the normal dark zones either dark Zone East and dark Zone West you have turrets at every checkpoint so there's no real checkpoint camping I mean you can camp the turrets if you want but the supply drops there are now three instead of just the one and each of them have one boss associated with it where in the invaded being Black Tusk all of the boss are on that one supply drop making it even harder it's a lot of fun uh also um yeah uh for PVP you would have uh conflict so conflict is actually right here at the base of Ops and this is uh my favorite PVP mode because it's just pure PVP and you can talk to this uh lady right here and go to conflict now the cool thing about conflict is that anybody can play conflict any level anybody can play conflict the thing about it though is you want to wait till you're level 40 because everyone's on a Level Playing Field now yes I did say anyone can play it I mean you can be a level 31 in play conflict if you want but you will be at a huge disadvantage against all the other level 40 players so you would want to wait until you're level 40 to PVP and you would just put a build together and you're good to go the reason for that is in Conflict the devs removed all shade levels expertise and all that so as long as you're level 40 and have a build I mean you're good to go really uh because everyone else is just using a normal build with normal stats just like you where if you were to go into the dark Zone in the dark Zone there's shade levels there's expertise is there's everything because you know it's the dark zone why not and with that you would have people that would have builds you know kind of like this I mean this is one of my dark Zone builds for example where my St Elmo's engine has a 28 expertise and we'll talk about expertise here in a second but what that means is my weapon is 28% higher than your standard level 40 weapon so if you were to have this weapon and go into the dark Zone you would be at a 28% disadvantage compared to me however if you go into conflict and play PVP and you have a normal St Elmo's engine level 40 and I have this one you know the holy moly Edition fully maxed out we would be at the same Level Playing Field because all of that is removed so that's what I mean by you know this PVP experience is uh for all players because it removes all of those extra advantages that the veteran players would have over new players and it creates an even playing field where everyone can go in there and as long as they have the build you're good to go right pretty cool now another thing about conflict I mean while we're here is that uh you get certain outfits that are well hidden so for example a lot of people ask you know what are these pants and shoes that I wear because a lot of people don't know how to get them and it's actually because they're PVP uh exclusive you can get these from dark zone or conflict but it's from leveling up you have to level up so that's a another incentive on the old PVP part of this uh game now that was the PVP parts of the map and I'll get more into the details for those game modes here in a second but going back to this map right you do have the uh season so you can see in the top left of your screen it says Scout progress so Scouts is the new Manhunt system they don't call it um your seasonal Manhunt anymore it used to be that you know oh we're doing our Manhunt Mission having fun what have you now it's a Scouts system where you scouting out you are trying to get information and then eventually you will get the climax Mission at the end of the season so how this works is you pull up your Manhunt right it still says Manhunt even though they're changing it to Scouts and you can see here that we have uh we're we're on Scout four out of 11 so for this season that we are currently in the game we only have 11 weeks for this Manhunt at the end of that 11 weeks you will then have access to the final mission it used to be called Manhunt takeover missions and now they are starting to call it the climax mission for each season so for this season it is a agent Kelo climax Mission and it will be unlocked in in about seven weeks right now the way these Scouts go is you get Intel and then you have to complete three activities so the Intel you can see in the uh top right you know of this whole Scout menu it will tell you where to go so for scout one it says go to East Mall uh the Intel for scout 2 says go to Southwest the Intel for scout 3 says go to downtown east and then of course we have Scout 4 that opens up in 4 days now what happens here is each of these activities are now riddles you just have to crack the code or you know Solve the Riddle whatever it is and then figure out what you need to complete to uh move on to the next activity so you have three activities and once you finish that third activity it will give you that Weekly collectible so if I open up the Collectibles here is the current season we are under burden of Truth and like I said we're only 3 weeks in so every Scout that you complete you get one of these Collectibles now this is what progresses the story for the division 2 right now building up to the DLC so to get the latest news or what have you about what's going on in the game you want to complete your Scouts and just listen to these audio recordings some of them are pretty good and they're not always in order so what I typically like to do is wait towards the later half of the season and then start listening to them all together because they uh they do tend to jump around jump jump jump around but that is your Manhunt Scout so looking back at that menu option just for examples here you can see these activities they're pretty simple it's you know complete a mission do three open world activities and and uh eliminate enemies with your Seeker mines week two you know another mission a bounty and then a control Point week three a bounty take on Black Tusk enemies and then a control point they're pretty simple things here but the whole premise of this is to get you to jump back into the game on a weekly basis and give you things to do some rewards in a new collectible every week building on the story to that climax Mission now another thing to note here in your menu is you can go to your legacy manh hunts now the Legacy manhunts these are just your final missions the climax missions if you will and it's for all of the I guess relevant Seasons so you have Jupiter Hornet shaer fa Lao Captain Lewis General Anderson stovepipe Maria Singh the recruiter agent Kelo and then you have the uh the latest ones for your six being kener Parnell and now finally Kelo again so this leads us all the way into the DLC now if you are just now joining the game here's a tips and tricks so this is going to be a good one all right so don't forget to hit the like come on I'm helping you out so Jupiter Hornet schaer and Fay la all give you skills you get extra skills all right now the cool thing about that is um some of them are really good skills whether it be the EMP sticky bomb or maybe one of those uh traps you know shrapnel trap healing trap whatever uh but my favorite is the EMP sticky bomb and you can only get that through these Legacy manhunts so if you are newer return in I would highly recommend doing these Legacy Manhunt missions even if it's just once because another thing the recruiter um that's a hunter that you take on the El agent Kelso you take on another Hunter right kener you're actually fighting with kener these are all really good missions that if you did not complete previously you might be missing out on these skills and Hunter masks because you do get those Hunter masks it's really cool oh and schaer there's a there's a hidden Hunter and Schafer as well there's a lot of really good things in this uh Manhunt menu so I highly recommend doing that and then catching up on your scouts because what they're doing now with the scouts is at the climax Mission they are hiding a exotic so for example last season last season we had Theo Parnell way down here in space uh Administration HQ so right here you can see I just toggled it to the Manhunt Mission theop Parnell and it says there as a reward I would get an exotic chess piece and that's what they're doing with these climax missions for The Manhunt system is that once you complete it you would then get access to the latest exotic and this is their way of making you play the game essentially they're they're making you do the climax missions because that's the only way of getting that exotic and then it's not going to be added to the general loot or anything until you you know get that blueprint and everything all right now that is your menu for that let me go ahead and pull up the normal menu again so we're done with the Manhunt so looking at this normal menu there's a few things to note here all right the first one targeted Loop on consoles it's just hit up on the d-pad and you can see uh on the bottom left of your screen where it shows hide targeted Loot and then show targeted loot hide targeted loot show targeted loot so every time you log in you want to toggle this up and see what's the targeted loot for that day and what it is you would be wanting to farm for for your build and we'll talk about builds and putting those things together in a little bit there there's so much information to go over but first let's just understand our map okay so that's for the targeted Loot next are bounties if you just toggle over to bounties each section will have their own bounties now to spawn a bounty in these specific sections you would have to complete task for example here in West pic Park you have these public executions if you complete a public execution look there's four of them right here that's crazy uh completing each of these public executions will give you a bounty as a reward and you can keep those bounties for later also uh if let me see if I can find one uh they handcuffs the rescue hostage operations I don't think I have one on my map I'm looking no I don't so you would also want to look for the handcuffs icon because what those would do is also give you a bounty as a reward but I typically just go for these public executions because they're always on the map I mean they're everywhere you can see right here public executions and then for whatever section you can just take these out and then stack up on your bounties and keep them for l later now next up you have your shepherding system okay your shepherding system this is a call status system to help out other players the shepherding ranks will reset every season for example you can see right here I am at shepherding rank seven and it says right below that that the shepherding rank will reset in 12 weeks that's when this season ends and the new DLC begins o now the thing about the shepherding ranks is you have to get endorsed for them to work so the way this works right here at shepherding rank seven it says that I need seven endorsements to go to shepherding rank eight I am currently at one out of seven so I would need six more end endorsements to get up to rank eight the way the endorsements work is you have to answer the call and help somebody out after certain XP or time allotted it will give that agent a popup that says endorse this person they have to endorse you in order for it to count so the player can say me no I'm good and not endorse you so this syst system it's okay but it's really like a trust system because you have to help out people that are not a part of your clan and you cannot just join your friend to get endorsed you have to use the call system and you have to you know answer the call to a random person so this system it's okay I get asked about it a lot there are some rewards that you get there's a few patches and a backpack trophy things like that to help out people this is really just a good system for you to call for help or call for backup whenever you're playing solo and you need some help so for example if I go to my map you can see in oh it says right now I cannot call for backup and that's because I have my uh my stuff on uh friends only private and all that but if I put it on Open group and then if I were to go to on call status and go to all what that would then do is that would give me uh a way to call for backup so then I could log out log back in do something in the open world call for backup and then somebody can come help me out now if it's a random person you'll be able to endorse them and then help them with that shepherding rank but for right now let's turn the on call status off and let's turn my my privacy back on that way no one messes with us during this uh you know this guide video going back to your map you would NE uh the next thing would be your matchmaking option so this is your matchmaking menu and you can do a lot of cool stuff in here so you could play the new descent game mode you could play The Summit game mode you could join some random Mission you could you know matchmake for the incursion or Discovery raids not normal raids but Discovery you can matchmake for countdown open World stuff random bounties random activities and then of course the Kinley College Expeditions whenever that's actually open now for that shepherding rank system you would do this one random call for backup where somebody's calling for help they would then invite you and then they can endorse you now the way this works is you can go into each of these and click the actual you know level of difficulty you want and have fun that way however for descent there's no level of difficulty that will just put you right into descent same with the dark zone for the raids it would only be Discovery raids and during those Discovery raids you will not be able to have access to the Exotics and we'll talk about the Exotics here in a little bit for the incursion you actually can matchmake for the incursion because it's only for four people and you can get the new exotic or boros from the incursion that way so that is a good option but I would stress that you would need the builds um you know needed for the incursion and you would probably need to know some mechanics or join a group that is willing to show you the mechanics in order to complete it because it is not easy if you do not know what you're doing and you do not have the build for countdown you can matchmake all the way up to heroic however on Summit you can go to Legendary also in Summit on legendary you do have access to those legendary raids uh legendary uh Exotics my bad now uh let's see anything else with this part of the menu no going to the other part of the menu you have your projects the projects have Chang changed just so you know going down here at the bottom you do have two PVP projects you can complete now uh they do switch between dark Zone and conflict so this week these are both dark Zone based and then that would mean that next week they might be conflict based you also have your weekly descent project which you get all of The Descent comms from defeating the Nemesis and we'll talk about that game mode here in a second but uh for those Collectibles it's another part of uh what would I want to classify that as like trying to stay up to dat with the story I guess because there are 90 descent coms and you would have to catch up by defeating the Nemesis every week and getting however many comps they want to give you each week just to get all of these comps now yes there are content creators and people out there that already have all 90 like myself so we can you know share the story with you and all of that but that that's just really the main part of that project is just to get those Collectibles and you can see under the rewards that they're really trying to get people to play it so they can catch up and uh learn more about the story going up here the new weekly Summit project now gives you an exotic cash just from completing 15 floors now Summit is 100 floors and we'll talk about these game modes more here in just a second but uh I do like how they're adding Exotics and more XP to all of these projects so if you're new or returning these projects are key for getting those extra Exotics and that extra XP now the weekly shade requisition project is by far the easiest project in the game and it gives you an exotic every week it also gives you one shade level every week and this is per character you can do all of these projects on every character and it will count however you need to be level 40 and for some of these projects you do need to complete Warlords of New York now this uh top project here the season pass project this one is only available if you have the season pass you do not have to buy the big season pass bundle but just from owning the season pass will give you access to this project and every single day it changes so all you have to do is one Mission or one stronghold what have you and you get all of these rewards every single day it is a big benefit having the seasonal pass and a lot of people don't even do these projects uh and it's sad because you also get bounties drops another shade level and more the next part of your map you have your conflict map right here you can just queue into conflict if you have your PVP and then of course you have your legend for your map now going into the uh other part of our menu let's talk about the season so the season has changed okay just by clicking start here is your menu the season menu is right here and this is completely different so if you're new or returning this is completely new all right so let me try to catch you up to speed on this the seasonal pass is only available to people that purchase the seasonal pass um the free items is what everyone gets but you can see it's only one or two items every you know few levels where the rest of it you would you know get from the seasonal pass and then you'd get these ultimates uh from the seasonal pass bundle now as far as the seasonal pass you can get seasonal pass XP from pretty much anything now and the devs are changing it to where you can get seasonal pass from pretty much everything as soon as they add that in next week's patch um so it's going to be pretty easy to get all of these levels but to be honest a lot of these rewards are locked behind the seasonal pass so you're going to have to buy it uh you can get the patches and some of these free items uh no problem but the Exotics and the skins and all that you definitely want to buy that seasonal pass and it's a few dollars every few months so it's not like a everyday expense I think it's a $10 for the normal version and then $30 for the uh big bundle and that is at the start of every season the next part of this is your seasonal Journey now the seasonal journey is something completely new and this was just added last season so this is new for a lot of people and they just up updated it again for this season now I have not even talked about modifiers yet because that is a part of the seasons as well so let's get through the Journey and then we'll talk about the modifiers so the seasonal Journey uh this is your seasonal progression for uh you know the start of every season this is how you're going to get your seasonal mask back in the day your seasonal pass at level 100 remember you used to get a mask not anymore the mask is Now hidden behind the journey and you can see right here under Journey mission 7 under completion rewards it gives you that snake apparel mask or helmet whatever so what this seasonal journey is is it's a way of getting you to play everything in the game and also use the modifiers that are uh new For That season so the modifiers uh this is this is going to be a long one people there is so much information so the modifiers change every single season it will completely change your gameplay it's to help your game play it's not to hurt you it's to help you it's to make you feel more powerful in different ways every single season so maybe one season it's like a you know sniper or range based and then this one it's more of like a uh eliminate enemies based for momentum you want to build up your momentum the more momentum you have the stronger you are and you can keep your momentum up and then you can just be very strong the entire time it's a really good modifier system this season this is by far the best season to come back to because these modifiers make it even more fun than what the game typically is so the way this works is you have three different tiers of modifiers for the agent and then you have one modifier for the hostiles let's talk about the hostil first so the hosts will be highlighted in red during this season if you have your modifiers active now yes you can can just deactivate it and not even worry about your modifiers but if you activate it you'll get to enjoy all of the new power that has been given to you but let's first talk about the Hostile modifiers so like I said some of the hostiles might be highlighted red and that means that they have this Talent active this is called the frenzy Talent so frenzy makes the enemy shoot fast f move quicker and heal themselves automatically that's forever that's during the entire season because you are so powerful that what they're doing is they're giving the enemies a way of healing themselves uh to try to put some sort of difficulty into this season now the way this works is it scales with your journey so the further you progress through your seasonal Journey the more modifiers you get which means the stronger you get but then also they are increasing this talent to the enemies so if you're done with your seasonal Journey that means these enemies they they're maxed out and you can see right over here on the right side of your screen uh chapter 3 chapter 4 chapter 5 and onwards so that means that if you go into your seasonal Journey at the very start you are at chapter 1 and three so that means your enemies have the first stage of frenzied already active the next one will not increase until you reach Journey Mission 4 and then Journey mission five and onwards so the further you go down your seasonal Journey the more powerful you get because you're getting all of these new modifiers but the more powerful your enemy gets because it's scaling with your journey now going let's see so we're talking about the journey and then we're into the modifiers right so that's your hostile modifiers now that gets them up to 30% rate of fire 30% movement speed and then they get 10% armor and health back per second now the only thing I want to note here is if they are frenzied they come out of the spawn frenzied which means that 30% movement speed you'll see some of the enemies running out of their spawn 30% quicker than they normally would and at first you'll think it's a glitch or it's a bug or something it's not it's just them with this hostile modifier and they're all Juiced up trying to take you out it's pretty crazy now that's it for the Hostile modifier pretty simple right it scales with the further you go in the season now let's talk about our modifiers how are we getting more powerful it's all about us right screw them it's all about us all right so for us it starts with the global modifier now this is active the whole time all you do is have your modifiers turned on and This Global modifier will be there for you now this is called Rogue momentum and it builds up with any type of kill you get it could be a skill kill multi-kill head shot kill anything weapons melee don't matter right the more you are you know going off you know he's on fire the more kills you get the more momentum you get it'll keep building up and building up and building up it's like a meter right you want to keep feeding into it because the more you do the more powerful you're going to get the cool thing about this is that this will keep scaling and scaling and you have opportunities of keeping it at Max for the entire Mission you're playing for the entire stronghold whatever it is you're doing just for example you're at Max momentum you you get 20% weapon and skill damage you get 20% movement speed yourself which is really fun you're going to love the movement speed trust me then you get 20% reload speed and 25% rate of fire all given to you just because you're playing the game and if you're playing solo that means you're getting all the kills yourself which means you're going to get this momentum to be maxed out pretty quick because you're the one getting all the kills now yes if you're playing with other people it's not going to count for everybody it's whoever gets the kill all right that is key there so for solo players this is even better because you're getting stronger and stronger and stronger the more you're playing the game but wait there's more because if you max out your momentum all of those numbers I just gave you you know the weapon damage the skill damage the movement speed reload speed rate of fire that's nothing compared to your uh overcharge so you get your skills overcharge that is insanely strong for example just looking at my skill right here I'm at a tier one overcharge would increase my EMP Blast by 150% % and the duration by 100% And that's for free just from using your modifiers or even better if you use something like your scanner pulse at tier one it's nothing right it just pulses the enemy affect duration but if you had a maxed out overcharged scanner pulse it gives you the extra Talent weakness exploit where you and your allies get Amplified damage to all pulsed enemies so using something like Rogue momentum in your modifiers and just by playing the game and getting kills you could turn something like the scanner pulse into a deadly skill against those enemies really cool now another thing to note in the bottom right of your screen it says blacklisted enemies so enemies that have a little indicator over their head will give you more momentum so you want to focus fire them I'll show you what that looks like uh I could do that right now so if you go into the targeting range you can actually see in the targeting range what a blacklisted enemy would look like and all it is is a little indicator over their head and this would give you more of that momentum that I'm talking about so if let's see here if we're just sitting here right and I were to pulse let me pulse my enemy and use one of my fancy Dancy uh modifiers here okay so here's here's my pulse right I'm pulsing the enemy and those indicators right there that those two indicators are blacklisted enemies just like this one right there that that's a blacklisted enemy indicator over their head all right same with the guy right in front of me that's a blacklisted indicator that I'm pointing at and what that does is if I take them out it gives me momentum it gives me a lot of momentum okay and that's what the bar right next to your ammo is building up and you can see how I'm I'm getting stronger and it's just going to keep going and keep going I mean I'm already at half momentum right there half Max that's crazy that's only a few enemies that I just took out and I'm nearly Max right then and there so that's how that works okay into your modifiers the next part is going to be your active modifiers now all of these extra modifiers you have to unlock so when you're just now new and returning to the game and you turn on your modifiers you'll only have that Global modifier giving you the momentum and the enemies will have that frenzy Talent that's it so for the active modifiers and passive modifiers you actually have to unlock them and the only way to unlock those modifiers is through your seasonal Journey now your seasonal Journey for everybody will start at 1 and three because you can do one and two while you are completing three the reason why they do that is because one and two do not give you modifiers as a reward you can see under the rewards claimed it's just you know cashes and materials nothing crazy but at Journey Mission 3 you get the explosive amp the critical recovery critical momentum all of those are passive modifiers that you can use for the rest of the season the next one Mission four gives you you can see right there overdrive active modifier and that's when you can start using your active modifiers then five you get Vendetta and then six you get tactical Supremacy these are all modifiers that once you unlock them you get to use them for the rest of the season until the new modifiers come in now what that does is it makes your Rogue momentum even stronger so all of those things I said you were getting weapon damage skill damage movement speed reload speed rate of fire uh your skills overcharged then it gets even bigger because now you have active modifiers now these can change your play style a little bit now the first one is overdrive what this does is it maxes out your momentum instantly and gives you bonuses so you get 30% weapon damage skill damage 30% rate of fire and unlimited ammo and that's for 10 seconds however then you get a penalty and there's a cool down but that's how they're getting you to be even stronger the next one my favorite for this season is called tactical Supremacy so tactical Supremacy will increase your passive modifiers and double their effects double that's my favorite one this season the reason for that is these passive modifiers are really really strong for example you have critical recovery here where Critical Hits would heal your armor you also have critical momentum here where Critical Hits will give you momentum so you can literally just be shooting an enemy get more momentum and heal yourself all at the same time and then you get more momentum as you kill that enemy and then it builds up and builds up so there's a lot of good combinations you can use in here and make your builds even stronger another example right here aggressive drone where that increases your drone damage but it takes away some of the duration but we all know that the duration is so high that that doesn't matter just get that extra damage you see what I'm saying anyways that is the short and sweet version of your modifier break down okay your modifiers will change every season so what you want to do is you want to grind that seasonal Journey that way you get your modifiers and then you get to enjoy those for the rest of the season until you get the new batch of modifiers with your new seasonal Journey also we have priority objectives this is something brand new that was added last season so for a lot of you that are new or returning you have never seen this before what this does is it gives you three different activities that are random and they give you random extra rewards so if you like doing strongholds like this one right here you would get an extra 700,000 XP just from doing Roosevelt Island and right now we do have that times 5 XP event going on to where then I could get 3.5 million XP extra just from doing this which is crazy now another thing you can do is you can abandon that objective so let's say I don't want to do that I can abandon it just like that boom now I can only do that once every hour however you do have right below these options is a roll capacity so if I don't like these three options let's say uh this one's resources exotic and resources for my rewards I don't want those so let's roll it now I have exotic resources resources I'm looking for XP so let's roll it again uh two Exotics and this one's e credits again I don't want that either let's reroll again ah I did not get XP at all so now I have to wait I have no more roll capacity and it says that I have to wait another 15 hours and then I get all three of those rerolls again pretty cool now as far as the three options it doesn't tell you what they are until you choose it so for example PVP let's see what it is it says that I have to open up any Dy chest by using a dark Zone key so I could go to any of the dark zones and just open up a chest and I would get this completed and get that extra reward now this goes on for everything in the game it'll be PVP tve strongholds missions countdown Summit descent anything so just uh remember you only have three rerolls but you can really capitalize on this a lot of people use this to get Exotics other people use this to get extra XP both of those are very smart ideas so take advantage of this if you're new or returning and then finally for our seasonal menu we have our new events timeline now you will notice that this season there are a lot of new things added to this game first up we just had a shepherding XP event shepherding XP I already talked about how calling for backup endorsing them you get the shepherding ranks they did just have a shepherding rank XP that way people could get you know their shepherding ranks up and try to get those rewards um because they know a lot of people do not use that uh part of the game as of right now we have a times five XP event and golden bullet everybody loves golden bullet and everybody loves times 5 XP now if you open this up it is for a thousand levels a thousand so if you are new or returning right now is the best time to get into the game you could get a, Levels by the end of this week five times faster than normal really really good like please take advantage of that not only that but then you also have golden bullet and you can use these together now just note here that the golden bullet Global event all those Stars will go to zero after the event ends so you would have to go to your Global event vendor and use those Stars so let me just show you really quick what that looks like so you're at the base of Ops here and there's also a location in Warlords of New York but I'll just show you this one so it's right here it's called the seasons vendor you open up this menu and you can spend those global event stars that you are currently getting from the global event now those will go away once the event ends so just to show you again you go to your seasonal menu toggle over to the events timeline open up Golden bullet and you would have to activate it and then you could you know finish these challenges get Global event stars that way or you can just get XP and get Global event Stars after every um you know level that you gain another thing here is you have a lot of rewards that you can claim during this Global event so don't forget to claim those as well there's a lot going into the game right now it is a lot now also note this times 5 XP is only for a TH levels so once you uh complete the A th000 Levels it's it's all done now other things during this season's timeline that is new right here we have Clan XP event coming soon we have a dark Zone XP event coming soon a x three XP event another oh a seasonal XP event so that could help you max out on your seasonal pass and then we have other Global events that will be associated with it pretty cool and that is everything with your seasonal menu now looking at other parts of our menu here we have our clan menu where you can pull up your clan you have your social menu where you can change your price privacy settings talk to your friends and then you have your apparel the store Ubisoft connect progression and settings now the Ubisoft connect make sure that your Ubisoft connect profile is connected to this game for any sort of twitch drops for any sort of compensation for any sort of anything given to people and players you want to make sure that you are connect connected to their Ubisoft profiles that way you get all of those rewards and challenges and what have you for the apparel and the store things have changed so let me show you so this is the new apparel menu this has changed completely uh from last year what they did is they squeezed in your typical apparel menu which was just these items then they added the outfits category so now you can change your outfits and they now have a backpack skins menu note here that the backpack menu for the Skins is different from the old apparel menu so look at this if I bring up my backpack I can go to the appearance slot and change the appearance right these are not the backpack skin these are just appearances from different backpacks the actual backpack skin is under the apparel menu under backpacks and this is where all the new backpacks are going to be just so you know and yes you can change the color of these just by clicking die and then you can change all of these backpacks and however they look pretty cool a lot of customization a now another one you can change your chest piece they now have different chest piece skins that they are coming out with pretty cool new gloves they're now coming out with uh glove skins and then knee pads they they don't have many knee pads that are available right now but they're they're getting more now what they also did was they threw down here your backpack trophies your patches your emote uh yeah your emotes and finally your skins lastly we have our store and our cashes so the cashes this is the only way of getting textiles in the game now I'm going to talk about vendors here in a bit right after uh the settings and uh the vendors there is one hidden vendor called uh Danny Weaver Danny Weaver is uh associated with Cassie Doza and the only way to get their locations is to find the snitch now the reason why I'm telling you this is because Danny Weaver sells Exotics and he sells other caches every week now those are only purchasable from textiles textiles are only available through here your apparel cach menu the reason for that is textiles are only only given to you if you get a duplicate item for example check this out so I open up a cash and it reveals a weapon skin I already have this weapon skin so it says right there that textiles were rewarded instead so now I have even more textiles you use those textiles to go to Danny Weaver and then you can buy those cash and get your Exotics and all of that pretty much for free every week pretty cool and then that leaves us into the uh the store so the store is completely new for the game they are adding stuff pretty much every week to the store and a lot of it is pretty cool uh others it's okay I do like buyer bust videos just to show people what the new bundles are every week and then we talk about it now things to note here here in the store is you can buy your seasonal pass I already purchased it so I can't pop it up for you but there is a seasonal pass and a seasonal pass bundle I I believe I already told you that the seasonal pass is around like $10 and then the bundle is like 30 now that bundle would give you like some extra premium credits some extra rewards outfits things like that or your typical seasonal pass will just give you you know the the bare minimum now going over here to the bundle category this is where you will now see all of the new outfits and bundles that are available in the store from the developers they change this every week so if you come in here there might be a different outfit every week right now they're redoing all of the Rogue outfits because all of the Rogue outfits just got a new backpack trophy associated with them but not only that they do have the St Patrick's uh outfit right now in the store and I'm sure they will do an April Fool's one here soon they were talking about doing an Easter one and giving everyone a Easter bunny outfit so we're going to have to stay tuned for that so those are your bundles in the store then down here your spotlighted items what the devs want you to see and then you have your premium credits which if you go to your premium credits every other season or so they have one of these one-time offers the onetime offer is the best bang for its Buck out of anything you do here because typically $20 would give you 2250 where here it's giving you 2600 and a new mask so that would be your best bet right there if you want premium credits is to just wait for those onetime offers and then take advantage of that now also in here under the store menu you can buy the expansion you can buy the seasonal pass the year one bundle the level 30 boost all of these things so you can get access to all of this uh let's see here what else in our menu that was Apparel in store let's go to progression so progression is a big one because of uh two areas one being the Collectibles that way you can listen to the audio coms and all of that and you know get familiar with the story but the other one the accommodations so the accomodations this is where you complete a certain task or whatever and you get a patch not only that but the higher the accommodation level you are you do get rewards as well so going into these categories some of these are super easy you know five consecutive head shots go into descent a few times you know complete some Summit things and once you actually complete these and claim them you will then get access to these patches and that's where you get all of your patches so then you go to your apparel menu and then you can access all of these patches I mean look at this I have hundreds of patches it's crazy it's a lot some of them are really really cool cool now another thing in your progression tab is uh your leaderboards so this is where you could see your clan stats your raid stats your descent St stats how fast you've done an incursion all of these things pretty cool your PVP stats your speedr running stats all of it dark Zone stats and whatnot and then that my dear agents will leave us into the settings category so settings this is going to be the part of the video where you're wondering what kind of settings you should use and why all right so let's just go through each of these categories really quick there's not a lot of settings to change I'll just give you the ones that I would recommend you take a look at so under the gameplay settings I would turn off the on call status unless you are actually trying to help people and do on call stuff because this will keep doing popup on your screen it'll say there's an agent nearby that needs your help there's an agent asking for help there's an agent over here that needs help and it will keep doing that that way it prompts you to go help them so if you put this on none you will see none of that okay next up I have let's see scroll down here additional field of vision make sure these are maxed out that way you can see I mean essentially further you want these Max maxed out even if you're just like progressing it a little bit at a time maybe you're starting at zero right so maybe started at like five and then work your way up to 10 maybe 15 all the way up to 25 now what this will do is it will help you react faster to things that are happening around you just just know that it'll definitely help you another thing is I turn the motion sickness mode off uh I don't need that next up we have the UI category I do custom the UI uh you are more than welcome to custom this however you want you can move your map around you can move your stats around all of it so that that's one of the cool settings here under UI next this is a big one floating combat text this one's huge a lot of people ask me about this setting so let me just show you in real time what it looks like that way you see exact what to change so you're shooting an enemy and you want your damage numbers to look different right let me show you how to do that so if I shoot an enemy all my numbers are right there to the right of my screen you can see all my numbers are right there so every time I shoot an enemy you can see all my damage numbers right there in a line and it just shows you how much damage I'm doing that's because I have have the combat floating text if you have the normal random sphere check this out you see how the numbers are different you see how the numbers are smaller and they're random the way they're popping out you see what I mean that's like old division one stuff we don't do that here in division two we change it to floating that way the numbers are bigger and we know exactly how much damage we're doing that way if we need to change it we can not only that but say you have a bunch of enemies you're shooting if I'm shooting all of these enemies you can see all my damage numbers are staying to the right of my screen if you have it on the other setting it all those numbers will just be jumbled up everywhere so check this out see all the numbers are just they're they're all over there and they're all jumbled up I can't even read that you see what I'm saying so that's why I have it on floating for the combat text uh raid speedrun only if you're doing uh raid speedruns would you want that on it's really not that useful other than that um n it's okay under audio setting I actually do have the music down low just in case I get hit with one of them copy strikes for the controls I have my sensitivity maxed out highly recommend commend you do the same if you're getting shot in the back it's a lot a lot more helpful to just turn around as fast as you can unlike if you had it on like say zero and you're turning you know hella slow you know like a sloth or something so I have both of these maxed out but just like the additional field of vision what I would do is just gradually progress this you know maybe from nine to 12 to 15 and then eventually get up to 20 because you will have a big difference in your gameplay you will react quicker and um I don't know it makes it a little bit easier another thing is I do not have the controller vibration on I think that it is uh distracting at best so it's just not something that I would typically do I have it off at all times the next thing is a dead zone for your sticks for your analog you know your your thumbs you want these at zero the reason for that is you want to be able to react the fastest you possibly can so what this does is it kills that space uh for your analog sticks so wherever you're moving your thumb it will move there instantly because you're moving your thumb where if you have your dead zone at say 10 it's going to take you longer to move your thumb and move you know your character than it would if your dead Zone's at zero so just have it at zero now another thing that this does and it's quite embarrassing to some people but if you have this at zero and your controller is broken your your uh character might just start doing this why is he moving like that you know you know what I mean or say your character just starts like moving slowly like in this direction it's because your controller has a broken stick so what you would then have to do is you would then have to go back into controls and increase the dead zone until there's no stick drift is is what they call it that's what she said you know whatever stick drift uh another thing on here let's go under Graphics I typically have my brightness up my sharpening up contrast up no neutral lighting none of that crap for VoIP uh I don't disable VoIP because not a lot of people talk on Console uh well at least not on Xbox they do talk a lot on Playstation so if you want to turn it off you're more than welcome to but I do not because I do like talking to other people but I will admit that if you are talking to other people you need to look at these two settings right here you need to have your volume boost and your threshold so what I would typically do is have my threshold about 25 and have my Boost about 2530 the reason for that is if I'm whispering I don't want my mic to go off if I'm coughing if I'm wheezing if I'm sniffly if I'm you know whatever if my uh pets come in if my kid comes in if my you know my my wifey walks in if I drop something I don't want you to have to hear every single thing that's going on around me so I have my threshold a little bit higher that way when I'm actually talking to the mic it will then respond another thing is your threshold volume boost you don't want this super high if you have it way up here whenever you talk it's going to make you sound like a freaking megaphone like you're through a drive-thru you know getting you know McDonald's or something you want this lower because you don't want your volume to be boosted really so you could have this at 25 or 30 and it'll just be just fine you know talk to me like we're in the same room you don't need to yell at me with a freaking megaphone you know what I'm saying so it'll definitely help you out there next up you have your accessibility I do high or I do high contrast and I do larger text it's just easier I also do the onscreen keyboard you'll see that a lot in my gameplay where I'll tell people GG's or I'll talk to them through that the onscreen keyboard only works if you're in a group and if you're in a group just hit down on your d-pad and you can talk to people through uh the onscreen keyboard it's pretty cool other things on here I do not do do the color blind setting I know there's a lot of people that do that I do not and that's actually pretty much it people for the settings not bad not bad at all all right now let's talk about the vendors and then we can you know start moving into the uh the good fun stuff of the uh game all right so the vendors your vendors change every single week you have three vendors at the base of Ops you have a vendor at every single one of your settlements and you have vendors at all of your dark Zone entrances so there are a lot of vendors that are here you also have a vendor at your Castle settlement theater settlement and then of course you have those hidden vendors now I keep saying hidden vendors the reason why I keep saying that is because they are wandering vendors that have hidden locations the only way to see these locations is you have to find a snitch so finding the snitch he will snitch them out and give you their locations so if I find a snitch let me just go to my typical location for the snitch yep there he is right there so if you find the snitch he is located in over a dozen different locations throughout the open world and he has question marks over his head so when you go to the snitch two things you get a bounty it says right here accept Bounty so not only do you get a bounty but it also shows you their locations so look at the top of your screen and watch this you see it says Gunrunner location revealed the gun Runner is Cassie Mendoza then you can pick up your Bounty and if you look on your screen you will then have an open Bounty go to the Bounty details and you can actually click abort and save that for later but the reason why I showed you that is because of these icons right here these are the locations of those two vendors so you have Danny Weaver and you have Cassie Mendoza these vendors open and close every other day so you can see in the top left of your screen it says this vendor is closed opens up in another day it says 23 and a half hours Cassie Mendoza sells items that are some of them are different but they are only purchasable with normal credits where Danny Weaver Danny Weaver will sell cashes and it's only with textiles so those are your vendors okay so those vendors will change every week and that's why I do a weekly vendor reset video for all of those vendors because it is quite a lot uh after the vendors let's talk about craft crafting because uh now we're getting into the builds and the Exotics and the weapons and all that crap because before you get into the game modes you probably should have a build right now a big part of your build is crafting and tinkering and all of that so let's talk about that system so over here at your base of Ops you have annia and you have Emma annia doeses your crafting where where Emma does your tinkering but you can use the tinkering station which used to be called the recalibration station you can use tinkering on the go what do I mean by that well they added this a few seasons ago where I can be anywhere in the game okay and if I open up my menu and open up anything like this I can go to the tinkering station right there boom right there and you can actually see in the bottom right of your screen there is an option that says tinkering station it's right between mod and inspect character so by clicking on tinkering station you have three different options here library tinkering and expertise you can do this anywhere in the game as long as you are not in combat if you're in combat it's not going to let you do this it it will be blocked out now those three categories are the exact same at the tinkering station with Emma so if we come back over here you can see it's the exact same menu so I just showed you how to access it in the open world or you can just come back over here and use it like normal now three categories you want to worry about the library first this is your first thing you want to worry about in the game if you are new or returning you want to max out your library period but the reason you want to focus on the library first is because you can't change your items and Max them out or change the talents or anything like that until you actually have all of these in your library for example if I did not have 15% weapon damage on my mask I would not then be able to change any of my masks to Max weapon damage so a good way of maxing this out uh there's actually two ways so for example if you have shotguns and you're just really trying to get that one Talent you can easily just come over here to the crafting station and just craft shotguns right here and just max it out you know you'll you'll find you'll find the talent eventually and you'll find all the attributes you need the problem is finding maxed attributes because when you have them Max you never have to worry about it again and then you can see all of these categories that are you know gold it means I have everything already maxed out and available that way if I have any of those items and I want to change it I can change it to whatever I want whenever I want however for right here you can see under pistols I do not have all of the talents so if I had a pistol and I wanted to change it to pressure point I can't because I do not have that available from my library pretty big this this uh this entire category needs to be maxed out as soon as possible so the first way of doing that I showed you was crafting right you could just craft whichever one of these categories over and over and over and just use all of those and donate them what I would also do is you can farm for them so for example maybe you're looking to max out your holsters right you could go and do targeted loot for holsters so where would holsters be right now right here so holsters are under Title Basin so then I could run Title Basin a few times and get some holsters and then I could come back and donate them into that Library another way is through those two game modes Summit and countdown Summit and countdown have this menu where you can change it to whatever targeted loot you want from any category you want and that is for both Summit and for countdown now if you change it on one it'll change it for all of them you can see so if I changed it to assault rifles it would then be assault rifles see now that is your two ways of completing your library as fast as as possible you want to do that before you go to the next category which is tinkering so tinkering looks different here than it does if you do it per item what do I mean by that well if you click on tinkering it will then pull up the categories and then it'll pull up these items I don't do it that way here's how I do it and this is a really fast way of doing it so let's say I got I don't know a new item right let's say I got a new chest piece um right let's just use this one for example so I got a new China Light chest piece I equip it and then I hit select and look at that it automatically brings up the item and it automatically shows me what I can optimize and or re-calibrate so then I could you know if I didn't have anything there I could change the talent I could change these attributes and then I could optimize them okay and that's just by highlighting the item let's see if I can do that uh for a weapon so a typical weapon let's see just the Slayer so I click on the Slayer then I click select and then it brings up the Slayer see and then I can change this attribute to anything I want right then and there now these Replacements all of these options are only available because I have that Library maxed out so that's why that is so important okay now the third category is probably the uh the least favorite out of everybody's and that is expertise so going back over here we have the expertise category now expertise like I showed you earlier is how you could get your weapon up to 28% higher than a normal person weapon and that is because of my expertise level so there are two things associated with this the first is becoming fully proficient and the next is expertise upgrading it how that works is you have to become proficient in that item and that will increase your overall expertise level so let's say I'm an expert right if I'm an expert with just uh knives then I would only be an expert with knives my expertise level wouldn't be that high right just just saying just overall but if I was an expertise with knives and weapon and hand-to-hand combat and Hardcore Parkour and all this other stuff obviously My overall expert level would be higher right in real life right same thing applies here if you are fully proficient in all your mask all your chest pieces all your backpacks everything if you're fully proficient in all your skills and all your brand brand sets and gear sets it will increase your overall expertise level for your character because it shows that you're an expert in all of those things you're fully proficient I'm fully proficient in shotguns well I'm fully proficient in shot you know whatever we we we all get it but the thing is is that there are 400 in 17 different items in the game that you have to be fully proficient in to get this max level that I'm showing you and you can see right under that expertise level 28 50 out of 90 that is your progress to go to 29 now the 50 out of 90 that is how many more uh proficient levels you need so you need 40 more proficient levels to then reach the next expertise level now I cannot go any further because right underneath that you can see it says proficient 417 out of 417 that means I have nothing else I can be proficient in and this is the max level I can currently be now you cannot make your items 28 and a half you have to wait until it goes to 29 and then make it 29 the way that the expertise works and I can show you that right here and right now is you get an item that is fully proficient all right so for example right here refactor mask so this refactor mask is fully proficient and you can see right underneath where it says skill tier it says expertise fully proficient now right underneath that it says no upgrades are active now just above that I have another refa Factor mask where it says expertise 12 and then it says plus 12% armor now this one where it says no upgrades available if I were to click tinkering right this is just to recalibrate it and optimize it however if I go to expertise upgrade it I could then go to expertise go down to that refactor uh right here here refactor it shows me all of the ones that are on my character that I can expertise upgrade and then I could just go right here and expertise upgrade it now it shows you the cost and it shows you that you would get 1% armor now that 1% armor is different depending on what gear items you have for example if I show you my chest piece you can see in the top right of your screen it says everyday carrier highend and right underneath that it says 158,000 armor that's the percent of armor that it is increasing so whenever you expertise upgrade it would be plus 1% armor of that armor number so on chess pieces it's 158 and you can see on all chest pieces it's all 158k for that armor number there in the top right of your screen if I go to gloves in the top right of your screen it shows Olympic gloves highend and then it shows 80k armor and then the plus one% armor that I would get from an expertise upgrade would be 1% of that 80k if I go down to knee pads you can see in the top right of your screen it shows Emperor's guard knee pads highend and then right underneath that it says 99k armor so again expertise this one is plus 19 and that plus 19% is 19% of that 99k armor so then it increases the armor value of each item now for skills it's a little different so for each skill your expertise upgrades will upgrade a different part of that skill so you can see on the right side of your screen it shows tier two skill underneath that it says expertise 22 where it's increasing my EMP Blast by 22% so that would be 22% of the Baseline EMP blast over on traps you can see the expertise increases the damage on the decoy it increases the threat on the pulse it's increasing the duration Firefly it's increasing the blind effect duration on the Chim launcher it's increasing the damage on the hive the damage on the turret y damage and you can just see where on different skills it would change different attributes so the expertise upgrade on say the uh what would be like the shield it would be active regeneration now if I were to change the Firefly you could see that the expertise upgrade for the blind effect would increase the blind effect duration the expertise on the Demolisher would increase the damage and same with the damage on the burster so it'd be different for whatever skill you're using so for the reinforcer Kim it would increase the duration of the Kim or the ins snare health of a riot foam but these expertise upgrades are very important in PVE and in the endgame because it makes you that much more powerful so if you were Max expertise with Max watch level and and modifiers I mean you're getting some crazy high numbers and that's why a lot of people are able to just walk through heroic content and into legendary now for the weapons it's always weapon damage no matter what no matter what weapon you increase the expertise it will forever increase the weapon damage so my number one tip and trick for this for your expertise is to focus on your weapons and then focus on your skills you do not need extra armor like that it doesn't help you that much but the extra weapon damage and the extra skill damage is greatly needed and that is everything with the uh settings under the expertise pretty cool right now going to the crafting station this is going to be uh some more information now first with annia you have to make sure you buy all of the blueprints from annia her stock will reset every week and she will sell random Blueprints and things like that for you it does restock every week however if you buy everything that she has it's not going to stock anymore just like what I'm showing you right here another thing with anayia is you can share Blueprints and you can share materials from one character to another by purchasing that through this vendor right here I'll catch you later now the crafting station itself there are quite a number of things here so first up you have your mods whenever you do um what like a control point points whenever you do certain side missions things like that you might get different weapon attachments if you do that you have to come over to the crafting station and actually craft them make sure you have a check mark next to all of your attachments because a lot of people forget that if you unlock these you actually have to craft them to get them on your character uh other things to note here um you can get improvised gear through your crafting bench so if you go to the other category you can see here improvised the special thing about improvised gear is that it gives you a mod slot for that item it does not give you a brand set or any sort of bonus but it gives you a mod slot for that item and that's very very important because for certain builds you could double triple quadruple down on certain mods that you would typically not worry about with a normal build so these improvised items are pretty unique and the only way of getting them is through your crafting bench now for example I might have one on me no I do not so if I go to my uh stash I'll show you really quick improvise right there boom so here's a good example I have double crit on a holster with another crit mod and then that way I can just double and triple down on crit on the one item now uh the crafting bench what else you can do is actually craft uh your named items so there's a lot of named items that you can craft I mean here's the hollow man visionario punch drunk there's a lot of items that you can craft that are named the way of doing that there are two ways of getting your named item uh blueprints the first one control points you can do level three or level four control points right by turning them from red to Green if they are level three or level four which means challenging or heroic you can get a blueprint as a reward now you cannot get every single blueprint in the game but you can get quite a number of them by using um those uh control points they'll drop them as a reward over and over and over and there are a lot of control points you can take over which means there are numerous blueprints that you uh have an opportunity of getting just by taking over those control points now the other way is through descent so descent gives you a cash called reconstructed so here's descent and we'll we'll talk about that in just a second but The Descent vendor right here gives you a reconstructed cash if you have enough of The Descent credits what this does is it gives you a random named item but then it also gives you a random named item blueprint and that is big for crafting your builds I think that crafting your builds is just as important as farming for your builds because if if you have the blueprints you can craft them and already have the build you want and then later on optimize it where if you're farming for the build you might not get all the items you need and then you're just sitting there waiting and waiting and waiting so in my opinion crafting a lot of your builds is the way to go and and it's actually pretty easy once you get all your blueprints so control points and descent reconstructed caches those will give you those named item Blueprints and then you can just craft those named item blueprints now what's in my mailbox what what is this oh I just got an exotic and two named item caches oh that's from my uh my twitch drops the other day nice so the twitch drops just worked very good very good thank you division for doing that live during my during my beginner guide very good okay so crafting you know how to get those blueprints all of that jazz now there are hidden blueprints by the way and they are through your specializations so if you go to your specializations you can see in the bottom right there's an option that says view field research if you click on view field research it'll bring up these you know research categories and stages what you do is you get exclusive outfit fits but you also get blueprints so right here here's the slepner for the Gunner if you go to the firewall this would give you the ammo dump blueprint if you go to the technician it would give you the sendoff blueprint and then you can see where just by doing those field uh research stages you're able to get different outfits different skins different emotes and uh those blueprints so doing all of that would make it very easy for you to craft whatever build you want but not the Exotics obviously you cannot craft an exotic you can only change an exotic um now for that it's different between weapons and gear items because gear items it keeps the attributes what they are and it just randomly changes the values where for the weapons if you were to re-calibrate them or reconfigure them through the crafting station it would change the bottom attribute so it's very dangerous to do that in the crafting station with your exotic weapons because if you had something like damage to targets at a cover and then you change it to like swap speed uh it's going to be uh quite quite a while before you get it back to what you wanted now just to show you what that looks like if I go to the crafting station I go to the weapons I can scroll all the way down to the Exotics and it's called reconfigure all right so if you reconfigure your exotic it would take your exotic and it would change that bottom attribute and it would change all your other attributes and just randomly you know give you different values now it will not take away your expertise so if you do reconfigure your exotic after years or whatever it's fine you'll still keep that expertise you're good to go next up let's see here so we went over that now I I think it's time to start talking about Exotics and builds because before we get into the game modes and all that and farming we need to talk about builds and how builds work right so with that we have to start with Exotics in my opinion because Exotics are very crucial for your build now what do I mean by that you know your Exotics are crucial well you can only use one exotic weapon and one exotic gear item per build so the way I typically use my builds and put my builds together is I start with well what exotic would I want to use and then after that I would typically put my build and you know work around that you know what weapon am I using what exotic gear item am I using all right now let's put a set set you know to help accent that so with that I can show you a few different build ideas here where I'm putting a build together and I'm like well if I want a skill build right maybe I want to use a status effects build well the first thing that comes to mind is well the V mask is a perfect status effects build exotic so I would start with the vile mask knowing that I want more stat effects I could then move to whatever talent I want and then move into whatever set I want to use along with it not only that but then you would think well if I'm using a skill build what kind of weapon would I go for and then you'd have something like you know maybe the capacitor where as you're shooting your weapon you get more skill damage well I'm using a skill build with skill tiers and it just so happens that the more skill tiers I get the more weapon damage I get on this weapon as well so it makes it you know pretty easy to think okay well if I want this type of build these are the Exotics I want to go for and then go for those first and that would go into like your farming methods and your you know your game modes now as far as the Exotics to look for right now it's kind of hard to say but we know that the most popular one right now would be the St Elmo's engine the capacitor those are by far are the two most popular throughout the fan base and in fact they just said that after six years of the division 2 the Saint Elmo's engine along with the Scorpio are the two most used weapons ever so the these are your ones you really want to go for and the reason for that is they're assault rifles assault rifles give you that mid to long range you know survivability aspect to it while you know dealing a lot of damage and then if someone you know jumps up on you then you'd switch over to your secondary or sidearm and do a little close quarters combat now back to the Exotics let me just show you some examples of Exotics that I am using right now so first up we have the pestilence the pestilence is a perfect exotic to use right now it has that damage over time it got an RPM buff it got a damage buff and it got a Reload speed buff this thing is by far one of the best Exotics to use right now uh Exotics Exotics uh the capacitor it's uh one of the best weapons to use right now because it's one of or it's actually the only assault rifle that can hold damage to armor and damage to targets set of cover and you can see that right there on the right side of your screen where I have both of those attributes on this exotic where most of these other uh ARS are just going to hold Health damage so the capacitor is really big on that not only uh not only does it have that going for it but also the talent giving it more skill damage and more weapon damage damage it's a big player the vile mask is a really important mask to use right now along with the catharus and the kyotes all three of these are very important to use right now in the game and I would highly recommend going for them all of these Exotics I'm about to show you just from these build loadouts I would highly recommend you put together uh for this one I have the coyotes mask you can get that through countdown Summit anything with uh masks I'm G to try to stay away from the exclusives right now for this build I have the St Elmo engine like I said that's one of the most uh fan favored weapons ever made so pick that one up as soon as you can and then also the catharsis mask you can get this one through any targeted loot just a farm for mask but the St Elmo engine what makes this one so special is it shocks your enemy it builds up shock ammo really really important for PVE and PVP because that will really turn the tides during an encounter when you're shocking your enemy and then the catharsis I actually got a big buff uh this last year the weapon damage that it builds up uh went from 30% to 45% and it still heals you and takes away status effects it's a really strong mask highly recommend going for it on this build the exotic I would say look for btsu gloves this is perfect for your healing builds perfect for support builds because not only does it give you those uh attributes you know healing with the repair skills but also skill haste but the talent transference uh the overclock what this does is every time you destroy your hive it overcharges and it's perfect for those uh support uh builds and especially resetting your teammates skills and things like that the next build let's see here's uh oh hold on wouldn't let me put that one on so we have the momento the momento is uh one of the best Exotics in the game highly recommend getting that one along with the ninjab bike both of these are really sought after Exotics because they both give you insane amounts of uh bonuses the momento gives you a short-term and long-term bonus but you have to pick up trophies as you kill enemies it's really good for solo players not so much for in group play because you have to get the kills to get the trophies where the ninjab bike it's active all the time so it helps you out no matter what no matter what situation just put it on your build plug and play and well these are just reasons why I'm showing you the Exotics so just a quick little rundown which ones so St Elmos capacitor uh what Lady Death iron lung pestilence Scorpio so that's six weapons catharsis coyotes vial three masks momento ninjab bike two backpacks btsu gloves and I would go for the Ridgeway Pride chest piece I believe I have that one in my stash give me a second and there it is right there Ridgeway Pride chest piece so those Exotics it's right around 10 or 11 Exotics bare minimum and those Exotics can be found anywhere you get Exotics though you can get them from exotic caches you can get them from any enemy drop anything like that the reason why I pointed out those Exotics specifically is because they're easy to obtain then you get your Build Together and you can go to whatever game mode you want uh or whatever raid or whatever difficulty you want right so with builds let me just try to do like a quick little build breakdown so each build you have your different categories right so you have your specialization which does not really make or break your build that much you have your weapons which are very important now I already told you and highlighted some exotic weapons you could go for you know have some fun and then you can uh craft or farm for whatever other weapon that you prefer next would actually be the build the build it's the six items that you have associated with your weapon and your specialization your skills that actually will make or break the entire experience what do I mean by that well you could be super um uh you could be super survivability based where you don't really want to ever die but you're not really doing that much damage you could be just pure damage and DPS based but then your survivability is going to be really low or you could even be like a skill build where you're not tanky you're not doing a lot of damage but your skills are doing it all for you I mean there's different play styles for everybody or you can mix it up and have a little bit of all now for example here this is a all red build so this is a all damage build right below that I have a all yellow build and this is a skill build and let's see if I have an all blue and then here's an all blue build where all of these are all blue now they're all three completely different play Styles and that's the Glorious part of build making now what I would focus on again for your builds first up would be the Exotic so what kind of exotic would you want to use then you would go at what kind of talents do you want to use the talents on your build are typically only located on your chest piece and backpack unless it's an exotic now yes your gear sets have talents associated with them and yes some of your uh you know bonuses could also play a big part but when it comes to the actual build making process your first step what exotic are you going to use your next step what kind of talents do you want to use that way you put the talents on your backpack and your chest piece and you can figure out what kind of brand set you want to use with that Talent or whatever gear set you need to use to unlock that Talent so at that point you would already have the Exotic weapon you would already have two of your six gear items for your build because you would figure out what kind of talents you want to use and then you'd figure out the rest right so what kind of brand sets what kind of gear sets and what combinations to use with them now for example this is a pestilence damage build the reason why I'm using damage with the pestilence is because this exotic weapon has a talent that deals weapon damage So based off of how much weapon damage you have it dictates on how powerful this Talent can be so I tried to put together as much damage as I possibly could so with that being said I first was thinking about my talents you know well damage-based talents you would typically either go for talents that increase your weapon damage or talents that amplify your weapon damage so for example this backpack has the talent vigilance now that increases my weapon damage see what I mean and my chest piece comes with the talent perfect glass Cannon which would then amplify my damage both of those would help out my exotic and that's what you call you know build Synergy you know you're getting the build to work together in this really nice structure to get the most out of it so after I found out what talents I had I was like okay well what brand sets or gear sets so looking at the backpack I chose Walker Harris because the Walker Harris brand set bonuses give me weapon damage and damage to armor both of those increase my weapon damage so then that would help out my exotic and then you'd look for other things so this one gives you damage to armor this one damage to targets at it cover this one Health damage and the next thing you know you have a build with everything you need for that exotic giving you the best you know outcome possible for that exotic and that's you know the same kind of logic you would do for any of these so for a skill build a good skill build exotic weapon would be the capacitor so boom shakalaka I got that then I wanted to go with like status effects well I know that the vi mask gives me status effects uh damage overtime debuff for that Talent so the vile mask is a shoe in right there so boom I already have those two items then it's like well what kind of status effect would I like to use well I'm choosing the burn sticky bomb so the burn sticky bomb goes perfect with the flamethrower specialization because that increases my burn duration and then I would want to spread that burn so then I chose creeping death on the backpack to spread that status and then I went with Electrique because it gives you status effects for that brand set bonus not only that but this gear set right here is called Eclipse protocol which also works with status effects and then you can see the build Synergy it's all status effects it works with the Exotics it works with the skills the burn goes with the specialization bada bing bada boom right then you could go into your armor builds right so let's go with a straight up armor build there we go as high as we could possibly go here's 2.4 million armor now the way to do that I mean typically you'd see you know 800,000 armor you know something pretty low this one has 2.4 million armor holy moly how did he do it well first up I went with my exotic my exotic is the provocator and this gives you armor as a core attribute just right off the rip and I was like well if I get damage resistance as that Talent maybe if I get as tanky as possible I could never die right so I was like well what could be my highest survivability to make that happen so I thought to myself well what would be a good backpack Talent a drillin rush a drillin rush gives me bonus armor on top of my armor not only that but it scales depending on how much armor you have so because I have 2.4 million armor the 20% bonus armor that's 20% of my base armor so the more base armor I have the more bonus armor I get see what I I'm doing there not only that but this is on a yzen geta brand set and the one piece bonus gives me total armor so then I'm increasing that Baseline armor even further which would then increase my bonus armor so that's just the two pieces right there and then I was like well what else would increase my armor overall well one piece helig guard gives me 5% total armor so there's that one and threepiece agis gives you 15% total armor so I get 15% from the gear set items 5% from each of my highend items and then I get damage resistance and bonus armor on top of all that other armor and next thing you know your 2.4 million armor with damage resistance and bonus armor coming in not only that but then you could use something like the technician which gives you a skill tier and if you really wanted to if you're nasty you could switch this over to a Defender drone yeah a Defender drone and with the right mod look at that now we're at 30% damage reduction on top of the damage resistance that we're getting and all of the armor and bonus armor see and just like that I showed you a damage build a skill build and an armor build just like that so that that's how I would do my build setup right you would go for your Exotics build around that try to figure out what kind of talents build around that and then go for whatever gear set brand sets you want to go on top of that okay very simple easy peasy lemon squeezy now you want to farm for those builds right that's the big thing farming what am I going to do about farming comicazi come on bro farming you want to talk farming all right let's talk farming so the first thing with farming is targeted loot right that's how you're going to find the items you want in the quickest manner possible not only that but the fastest way of doing this is countdown or Summit now these are two completely different ways of farming but they both have similar results so countdown you can change your targeted Loot and playing count down you're with eight players and you're doing a lot of objectives and hunters and things like that you're getting a lot of kills and a lot of Loot and it's all instant and it all goes towards your targeted loot a lot of loot it's amazing the number one place I would say farm for gear is right here countdown not only that but if you pull up the countdown menu I would tell you to do it on challenging that is the the most popular difficulty for this game mode and you are guaranteed to find people I mean just just to show you really quick just watch how fast okay let me I'll show you how quick this is so if I were to do matchmake countdown challenging watch this one two three it took three seconds right it took that long you see what I mean so that that's how quick it would take to just do a countdown challenging and change your targeted Loot and just get your gear that way that's the number one way of doing that okay the other way is Summit but to show you how this one works I actually have to fast travel over here and show you and this is kind of segueing into the game mode so I'm I'm talking about how to farm for gear and then we're going to talk about these game modes we need you to we might as well do both at once right all right hope you cleared your schedule so I talked about I talked about countdown and I have a countdown 2025 guide video that is already on my channel so you can just type in my name and type in countdown 2025 and you'll see that and same with this game mode Summit in fact I have one for descent as well so I'm going to fly through the game mode part of this video and just kind of hyperfocus on the farming part okay now Summit what's cool about this is you can change your difficulty and your directives as I just said that I uh just realized that we have not talked about directives yet and well there's a reason for that the reason is is we haven't talked about farming or increasing your difficulty or anything because we've been focusing about all of the bare minimums first like you know the foundational stuff what to look for what settings what builds what to look for Exotics what to look for so now that we're talking about the game modes and farming we do have to break down directives so directives play a big big role now the thing about changing your difficulty right you can do normal all the way up to Legendary cool cool cool cool cool cool right all that does is it increases your enemies but it also increases your drop quality for your loot so whatever loot you get on normal you would get the same amount of Loot on legendary but it would be better quality loot so maybe on normal you would get like a 5% weapon damage roll maybe on legendary you would get a maxed out 15% weapon damage roll it would still be the same drop but it would be better quality based off of your difficulty now the thing about that is is it only really applies to challenging heroic and legendary the developers have said that they have increased the loot quality on challenging heroic and legendary normal and hard you're pretty much getting the same stuff hard is just basically the enemies are just a little bit harder nothing too crazy now the reason why I was talking about the difficulty is because the next part's directives directives play a direct role in your loot and your targeted loot this is huge so Summit it's different from countdown where in countdown you get loot no matter what and it's instant like you play one game a countdown you'll get 30 40 items of loot in Summit it's not that common so there's different ways of increasing your chances and your quality all at the same time and it all goes to your targeted loot so you could probably if you focused on it hard enough you could get better loot faster in the summit than you could countdown where countdown you're just getting a crap ton of loot just but it's all like me it's all decent stuff it's okay but it's not all God rolled stuff where in Summit if if you really tried I can show you how to hyperfocus on this and get all God rolled items so how you would do that pretty simple You' go legendary for the highest loot possible and then You' add directives now it says right here under directives it says activating these directives will let you change how you play the game you can have more than one active at the same time and the recommended maximum is pretty much five anything over that the devs feel is a little bit of Overkill but you can get more now it says here that activating those directives will give you more XP and increased targeted loot chance so if you're really going for that assault rifle you would want directives on with assault rifle as the targeted loot that way you get a higher chance of getting those assault rifles to drop so for example if I wanted maxed out assault rifles I would put on all the directives look at this 188% increase woo that's crazy but again that's with all the directives so what did the developer say they said five so one two 3 four five so they're saying just do five and that would be a plus 125% not bad at all now it says that each directive slightly increases the chance for targeted loot to drop alongside normal loot so like I was saying with the difficulty normal and legendary you would get the same loot but it would be different quality where on legendary it would be maxed out normal it' be whatever you know subpar what the directives do is they add targeted loot items to those normal items so now if you're on legendary you get that high quality loot but now it also giv gives you a chance of getting targeted loot with it and then you're getting double the legendary drops right so you're doing it that way pretty cool but the way of really maximizing your summit drops is going to be the challenges this is huge this is really important because each of these Summit challenges give you more and more rewards more and more targeted loot loot you can see at this bottom reward it gives you four times the targeted loot items two Exotics and XP and all of this gets what times five because right now we're doing a times 5 XP event so you could really capitalize on this right now where all of these caches and everything they'll all give you targeted Loot and things that you're looking for and all you have to do is complete any of these challenges while playing descent so so the way to really maximize or uh Summit the way to really maximize your summit experience is to increase your directives and increase your difficulty I typically go H heroic and I'll do typically you know five or six directives and then I'll do it like that and then that way whenever I do my targeted loot whatever I'm going for I know I'm getting more loot at higher quality and that's how you would pretty much do that for Summit now Summit is just a PVE and I do have a summit video breaking down the whole thing floor by floor and explaining everything with that and same with countdown so again you can look these things up on my channel just by typing in you know Summit 2025 or countdown 2025 or descent 2025 safe area detected which kind of rolls me into descent so for targeted loot those are your two places Summit countdown countdown you get loot instantly Summit you kind of got to work for it but it could be better quality now as far as descent descent is a whole different animal this is a rogue light game mode it is a oneandone game mode so if you die it's all over it's a simulation now this simulation has different talents that you can use while playing it have a lot of fun customize your build blah blah now the big thing about descent is it gives you access to the reconstructed cash and it gives you access to this exotic rifle it's the only way of getting this exotic rifle now the reconstructed cache gives you those named item blueprints so like I was showing you in the crafting station there are multiple named item blueprints in the game there's over a hundred actually and what this does is it gives you access to more Blueprints and in turn giving you access to more build combinations at your fingertips like you can just make whatever build you want um for example the build that I showed you right here I can craft this entire build because I have all of those blueprints so I had the sacrific ches piece here's the sacrifice blueprint right there and so on and so forth and then same with like the hollow man here's the hollow man same with the contractors here's the contractors uh crafting is a big deal for build making uh it is a big deal and descent is the number one way of getting those named item blueprints I know a lot of people do not like descent I get it but the grind is worth it I promise you it helps you for all future builds and it gives you those blueprints forever you never have to worry about it once you get them bada bing bada boom you're done you see what I mean and that's why I have separate videos breaking down those three game modes because there is a lot that goes into them uh and it would take way too long to then you know explain all of those again so we went over farming we went over the different game modes now what do you want to play right what do you want to do well there are only so many things you can do first up is you have your open world this is PVE only all right you have your open world activities you have your open world checkpoints now to change those difficulties um it's actually just like the summit where on the bottom of your screen you can see where it says Global setting right next to the close map um you know it says Global setting if you click that you can change your Global difficulty your Global directives and even reset your control points now what this does is it scales all of the enemies on your open world map so right here you can see it says control point four and it has a four next to all of these control points the level four means it's heroic and it's the hardest that you can do your Global difficulty you can see right here it goes normal hard challenging heroic now another thing is you can add Global difficulties to your open world and this plays the same role that it did in the summit where you could put five of these on and have the same outcome that plus 125% but then obviously you have all of these directives you have to worry about where like pistol you can only use pistols fragile armor once your armor breaks it's broken fog of War you don't know where the enemies are like all all of these but it does help because again the more directives you add the more XP you get but it also increases the chance of those targeted loot items to drop with your normal loot items but I'll keep mine here on heroic with no directives because I'm not really farming right now for anything but that would be your open World stuff right and then just remember these control points if it's level three or higher you can get those Blueprints and then once you get all of those blueprints you never have to worry about that again either so the open world is pretty fun and if you use the priority objectives like I showed you earlier from your seasonal menu you could really like get some nice loot Exotics XP and all that really fast in the open world not only that but here's a good tip and trick um your public executions give you the most XP so you can see right here public execution as a reward it gives you 230k XP if we go to a territory control it it doesn't give you anything near that here's a propaganda broadcast 217 let's see what else we have here territory control 30 ew but if you go to the public executions again they're 230 each and that's without directives that's just here on heroic but you can that 230k check this out if you added the directives and I'll just show you the effect right here now it does affect the those XP bonuses and you can check those out right now so here's with the directives active and now if I went to the public executions let's see here public here we go instead of 230 now it's 518 so now I get 518,000 just from taking over a public execution and these only take a few seconds to complete it it's truly that simple very cool and very easy so if you're just now coming back into it I would start with with like maybe fog of War you know maybe one or two directives that way you get a little bit of a bump but it's not too hard and then you can just you know gradually increase that over time all right so that is the open World part now if you're going to Farm open world go for the control points and the blueprints and go for the public executions for the extra XP next up is we have the missions right so we have missions and we have strongholds so the missions can only go up to heroic where the strongholds can go up to Legendary now the cool thing about that is sometimes if it is invaded you can toggle it invaded on and off you cannot toggle every mission on and off invaded it's just not possible it has to be first invaded then you can toggle it back to normal and then toggle it back to invaded But that is only available to the missions that are invaded that week and the strongholds that are associated with it so this week the stronghold is capital and then you can switch it on and off see just like that uh next up we have our uh let's see so we did the game modes we did the farming we did the open world I already talked about PVP so now it's talk about the raids right so we have the Dark Hours raid we have the Iron Horse raid and then we have the Paradise Lost incursion now the thing about the raids is you cannot matchmake for these raids unless you are on uh Discovery difficulty and if you're on Discovery difficulty you cannot get the raid Exotics so the raid Exotics you have the eagle Bearer which is locked behind the Dark Hours raid you have the the ravenous which is locked behind the Iron Horse raid but then you also have the regulus which is also locked behind the raid Iron Horse so with that to to matchmake for those raids you can come up here to the helicopter pilot right and you can matchmake for the discovery raids but again you will not be able to get those Exotics unless it's on normal so for H for Xbox PC PlayStation what you need to do is look for the looking for group so right here you can see the looking for group icon here on Xbox and if you click on this you can see right here encour DPS control points level four I mean Paradise Lost right here bring Striker legendary Summit floors there's a lot of uh options you can have when it comes to matchmaking and getting raid teams or incursion teams now the incursion exotic is called the oroboros and that is this exotic SMG right here now luckily the incursion you can match make just go to the helicopter pilot again and it is right here at Merit estate and then you can matchmake for it but like you just saw in those looking for group posts people are going to want you to have the builds in order to do those so what I would do if I were you is focus on the earlier game modes so countdown Summit descent do your open world farming for your blueprints get your builds together maybe do a little bit of dark Zone if you want and then once you have your Exotics and your builds then go for the raids and the incursion for those exclusive Exotics but that is pretty much it everybody that's your beginner's guide so while you are farming while you are getting all your builds together just note that you only have 150 in your inventory and you have a stack cash that can hold up to 400 now the 400 part of the stash is only if you have the Warlords of New York expansion and you have the year one pass that includes these classified assignments if you have both of those purchased you will have a 400 stash but if you do not have those purchased you will only have a 300 stash now with that your stash can be used amongst all of your characters and you can uh put different Builds on different characters and have fun that way the last thing is Scavenging points and then we'll get out of here so making new characters is the last thing we're going to talk about you can make a new hardcore character if you want or you can make a new normal character hardcore characters if you make a hardcore character if you die you have to delete your character now you can toggle that every time you make a new character but I'm just going to show you what these uh these alternate characters look like so here's my character number two this is my female character now this character has different builds and everything different what have you but we all share the same watch so the Scavenging points once you have your watch fully maxed out at shade level 1000 all of your levels will then go to your Scavenging points so 1,000 levels will Max this out and then everything after will go into here the shade levels after 1,000 don't really matter the only thing that it really does after shade level 1000 is increase your health so you can see right under my shade level it says current health boost 60,000 that current health boost is only available uh because I reach shade level 2000 so from shade level 1,000 to 2,000 there's absolutely no difference except for your health and then after shade level 2000 on words there's absolutely no difference at all so if you were shade level 2000 and I'm sitting here at shade level 12,000 we have the exact same numbers and the exact same health so it doesn't really matter past 2000 just so everyone's well aware now everything past that will give you Scavenging points these Scavenging points can be used for different types of materials it can be be used for credits all of these types of materials and then optimization uh materials the optimization materials will help you optimize your items to Max if they're not already and then these materials can help you craft stuff or what have you for anything in the game what I typically do is I put a lot of my Scavenging points into credits and then I just dismantle all of my gear and mods because that will give me my materials so I'm not wasting Scavenging points for materials because I know I'm going to get materials just from dismantling gear and then I put it all into e credits because you get 11,500 e credits per Scavenging Point that's a lot I mean just right here what am I at 10 million let's see well now I'm at 10.5 million and now I'm at 11 million credits that's simple and then that way if I have any other gear items I can dismantle them they can go into my materials good to go or I can buy items because I have 11,000 credits on this character and then I can just dismantle them that way there's a lot of advantages with having multiple characters because then you can hold like for example this character has all my gear set items and then I can just hold these for later but I mean you can see how this character is just full of gear set items for all my builds and that's how I I do all of my builds and get all my materials and all my credits I make different characters I stack the Scavenging points and then I go to the crafting bench lady her name's annaya and I share the materials you can stack them on top of each other over and over and over you're good to go and that's how I made all my builds that's how I crafted all my builds and that's how I play the game so I hope that this has helped you uh you know learn something new about the game and that's it for me I am ComiCon zon doom and I hope you enjoyed my beginner guide hit the like And subscribe you know the whole YouTube Spiel and I'll see you in the next one and if you didn't know this year I am trying to stream more on Twitch so you can support me and follow me over there on Twitch but again I'm kamazi Von Doom take care of yourself enjoy the rest of your day and I'll see you in the next one agent peace out"}, {"source": "YouTube: The Division 2 Complete Starters Guide! New & Returning Players Tips & Tricks (2025)", "content": " Since the release of the newest DLC for The Division 2 Battle for Brooklyn, I've been seeing new and returning players. And the one thing all of them have been telling me is, \"Yo, Skills, I feel overwhelmed. I honestly don't even know what I should be doing or what I should be focusing on.\" So, if you're new or returning, well, hopefully this helps you guys out. So, if you're just getting into The Division 2, you probably have either one of these options. If you just have the base game, you'll have the main campaign. If you have warlords, you also have the option to skip straight to level 30 and do the warlords campaign. And if you bought Battle for Brooklyn, well, you'll have the level 40 boost and you'll be able to go straight to Battle for Brooklyn. My recommendation, if this is the very first time you are playing this game, I 100% would recommend doing the main campaign and working your way through the story. Now, the reason for this is you will learn a lot just playing the main campaign with the tips and tricks that The Division 2 has built into the game. Now, when you first arrive to the base of operation, you'll be able to speak to the quartermaster and he will give you your first skill, which they pick the skill for you. It will be a pulse. Now, once you unlock this skill, as you progress through the story, you'll be able to unlock a second skill. Now, if I were to have to pick one second skill along with this pulse, I would personally go with the revor hive. The reason why is if you were to go down, it would automatically deploy and pick you up. So, this will be the second skill I would really push for. And as you continue to level up, you'll be able to fully unlock all of these skills and their skill variants, which most of them have three to four different skill variants for each skill. Now, from level one to level 40, my recommendation as you level up is just continue to put the higher level gear on. So, if you get some things that's level five and you currently have stuff that's level three, what you do will swap it. If you have something that's level one and then you have something that's level two, well, you'll put that level two gear on because your armor on that base gear is going to be better and the rolls tend to be better, too. So, anytime you get anything that's just a little bit better, you're constantly going to swap out for that next better item all the way up to 40. And at level 40 is when you'll start worrying about builds. Also, at the quartermaster, you'll have what are called perks. Now, to level these up, you'll need ShayTech. And this will actually be where you get your first weapon mods unlocked. Also, they have perks in here that give you more XP. So, it increases the amount of XP maybe for the amount of head shot you get, weak points you hit, or just surviving. You can also get more armor kits. There are a ton of different perks that you can spend your ShayTech on. And this is something that you guys should definitely be leveling up as you guys are going through the campaign and you earn more Shade Tech. Now, every time you do unlock a new safe house in one of the districts, it will open up the map and sometimes you'll even get some bounties. And why are these bounties good? Well, the bounties are good because if you look at them closely, they give you blueprints for either gear or weapon mods or even weapons themselves that you can go and craft afterwards. So, after unlocking a blueprint, you would go to your crafting table and then, for instance, I have all of these unlocked. Say I want to get a really good weapon attachments. Maybe for my 5.56, I want the 20 round mag. So, what I would do is I would go to the sturdy extended mag, right? I would need to craft it. But once I craft it, it will be unlocked for all of my 5.56 weapons. Now, side missions aren't the only place where you can get blueprints. You're going to want to speak to the project officer, and as you continue to level up, they will bring you more and more. As you guys can see, these goal projects offer me two different types of blueprints that I can later craft. And each settlement, the campus and the theater both have project officers. Another great tip for you guys is early on when you get gear and you don't need that gear anymore, I would sell it to the vendor. Sometimes you can use that money to either buy something that you really like from the vendor or to even level up your crafting bench. Now, once you do hit level 40, that's when you can start to deconstruct these items for the materials. Now, once you hit level 30, you'll be able to select specializations. Now, specializations are a cool way to make your builds unique, make your character feel unique, and the reason why is each one of these specializations has different types of perks that make you feel stronger. Now, how do you level these specializations up? Well, one way is to do projects that give you specialization points. Like your daily project gives you three specialization points. Your weekly projects will give you five specialization points. And your invaded missions will give you five specialization points along with your strongholds that also give you five specialization points. And every time you level up after hitting level 30, you'll also get three specialization points on top of that. And with those points, that is how you will fill up your specialization. as you can start to fill these up. Some will cost you five points, some will cost you one point, some will cost you three points, but you will level all these up. And once you hit 165 points, well, your specialization will be fully maxed out. Now, you finally hit level 40, what should you do? Well, that's where the fun begins because builds is what makes this game fun, right? You need to find a build that makes farming other builds easy. That's kind of my motto in The Division 2. get that one build that makes farming other builds so that way you can make lots of builds, right? But first off, we have to figure out what is a build for you new returning players and what should you be looking for. So, The Division 2 has what we like to call green gear sets and those have a two, a three, and a four piece bonus set. So, at minimum, you need to have two pieces of that green gear set, but at maximum, you want to have four piece so you can unlock the unique talent. We also have what we call brand sets, and those have different attributes that unlock depending if you have a one piece, a two-piece, or a three-piece set. On top of that, we have exotics that come in weapon and gear, and those have a unique exotic talent that is tied to that weapon or tied to that gear set. Now, to farm any of these items, what you want to do is go to the bottom of your map and turn on targeted loot. And then you can look at your map and find where that specific gear set, brand set, weapon is, and you can farm those areas. Sometimes it can be a full district. Sometimes it could be a mission. If it is a full district, what I mean by that is it will be everything in this area. All the activities from control points to public executions to propaganda. Your global difficulty should be on the difficulty you can do. Maybe you have to start on hard until you get a gear set or brand set or build you like. Once you feel like you're comfortable there, go to challenging and hopefully at some point you'll go to heroic. Now, the harder the difficulty, the better the roles you will get from these activities. Now, once you reach level 40, you'll also receive a watch. Now, you may ask, well, why is the watch even important? Well, it has an offensive, a defensive, a handling, and utility area that you can spec into points. Now, just to give you an idea on the offensive side, you can gain 10% weapon damage. You can gain 20% headshot damage. You can gain 20% critical hit damage and 10% crit chance. On the defensive side, you can gain total armor 10%. Now, all these attributes are just going to make you a stronger player because your builds will become stronger by using this. Now, once you hit a thousand shade level, all of these will be completely full and everything after that will go to your scavenging, which is just extra points you can use for materials that you may need to maybe optimize, reroll, or recalibrate your gear. Now, while you're working on your shade watch level, you should also be working on your library. Why is the library important? Well, the library is going to allow you to get different attributes that you can then roll onto gear you find in the open world that you're farming. Say you find a piece that you've really been looking for, but it doesn't have the talent you want. Well, if you have the talent in your library, well, you can put it on your chest piece. And that goes for any attribute in the game. As long as it's not an exotic, you can roll those attributes or those talents to those weapons. As you're seeing here, I have damage or targets out of cover. And then I have 11 replacements in my library that I can change for that damage strike cover if I really wanted to. Take a look at these gloves. I can replace this 11% weapon damage with armor skill tier or even a maxed out weapon damage or I can replace the attribute headshot damage for any of the other 11 attributes. That is what's cool about this. This is how you guys can make your build stronger without having to worry about getting god roll drops. And everything you don't put into your library, the rest of that should be marked as junk. And you should be using it to level up your expertise. But how do you level up expertise? Well, there are three main ways to level up your expertise in the game. By using a weapon, by donating that weapon, or by donating materials to that weapon. Once you have yourself a decent build and you want to get maybe some other builds, definitely check out Countdown. It's one of the best places to farm target loot as you can select the exact target loot you're looking for. This is also a great place to farm specific exotics in the game. My recommendation is to only do this on challenging as the eightman scaling health pool for the enemies on heroic can sometimes become an issue and you'll fail more than you'll succeed. Now, if you're struggling for build ideas, I highly recommend checking out my other channel that has a video called Top Five PvE Builds, and this is definitely going to give you some really good build ideas. And every one of these builds can be used on heroic content, and I even have a raid and incursion build in there. So, don't be shy and check out the playlist as I have a bunch of tips, tricks, guides, hunter guides over there, and different playlists for The Division 2. But I'm going to wrap this one up, guys. I'll see you in the next one. Hey, nothing but skills is out. [Music]"}, {"source": "YouTube: Laugh at Legendary with This Tank Build - The Division 2", "content": " Yo, Bendyos, what up? It's your boy Tux here. Today, I'm showcasing you a tank build in The Division 2 that lets you laugh at death. This thing turns you into a brick wall. Enemies can't break you down, and you'll be soaking up damage like it's a joke. Trust me, with this setup, you're tankier than a tank on steroids. And don't stress, it's super easy to put together. I'll walk you through every step. No sweat. Stick around because by the end, you'll be the toughest agent out there and the team hero. Let's do this. Wait, did we just become best friends? So nice to meet you. Wristwatch. This build might seem like that trusty tank setup the pros lean on for the toughest stuff in the Division 2. You know, the one that's been clutch forever, but hold up because the new season modifiers just juiced it up like crazy, giving it a wild edge over the old school version. It's loaded, so those yellow bar jerks hit like nothing. 100% hazard protection, making you immune to disruption and all that mess. Especially annoying when a Warhound pops right next to you. Yep. And there's even explosive resistance, so you can shrug off those booms. Plus, it's got unreal healing and more importantly, infinite shields, so even if your shield does break, which is possible, but trust me, after a lot of work by the entire battalion of the White Tusk, you can get it back instantly. So, you're right back in the game. This is the team build that puts you in the spotlight as the hero and everybody's got to have this in their loadouts this season. I'm not usually a tank build guy, but this thing was super fun to run in legendary. Let's take a quick break to walk you through the build. If you already have a foundry tank build, then yours might look fairly similar to this and there won't be much you need to change. But let's start with the key piece. It's your bull work shield. This is a tier six shield. It has over 25 million in health, making it pretty hard to break, but it can break. And so you need something to support your shield because believe it or not, 25 million in health is still not enough for the white tusk. We're running the artifice or hive that's going to give a periodic boost of repair to that shield. You can't solely rely on this to regenerate your shield because it's just not enough on the most difficult content in the game. In order to get that artificer hive, you're going to need to make sure you run technician. It's really important that you run the Liberty, not the Mosquito, because you need to continue to drive heals to that shield if you want to be in the game forever. The Liberty works like this. Hits grant 2% weapon damage, stacks up to 30 times. Head shot consume all stacks, repairing your shield for 3% per stack. 3% of 25 million, right? And this is a key piece to a never die tank build. You need to constantly be regenerating your shield if you want to take all the damage that the enemy can give. Okay, let's get into the core of the build. Boundary, you need four pieces. I'm running the chest piece. So, this is going to give you total armor, armor regen, shield health, and then makeshift repairs is what it's all about. So, whenever you or your shield take damage, 25% of that amount is repaired to both over 10 seconds. So, you're healing and your shield heals, whether you take damage or your shield takes damage. So, you're constantly healing. And then improvised materials increases makeshift repairs from 25% to 35%. So more heals per second. And then you want, of course, maximum armor on everything and a little bit of explosive resistance and a little bit of protection from elites. You don't want to overload on both of those because there's an equation here to get an immunity to all hazards. You're going to be immune to every single hazard in the game. You want to be careful how much you load up everything on the build. So explosive resistance on the chest. The gloves have armor and hazard protection. The knees have armor and hazard protection. The holster has explosive resistance. So, I have two explosive resistance on the build. I wish I had three, but I just didn't have the perfect backpack. So, this is Hila Guard. It gives you more total armor. That easy. Hazard protection, armor regen, and another protection from elites. So, we now have two protection from elites on the build. And then you want adrenaline rush because you're going to be in the face of enemies and this constantly refreshes and it's a lot of bonus armor. Totally worth it. And a lot of this is to protect you from the splash damage from explosions. It's going to kick in even when a drone is near. And it's also going to help protect your backside. Now that armor regen I wish was explosive resistance. If you can get that in there, do so. And I didn't cap this hazard protection cuz I didn't need to. All right. The mask is technically optional sort of. This is giving you heals and weapon damage as you take damage. If you put repair skills, it's going to give more power to your artificer hive. So, go with whatever you prefer. Vicious cycle. Taking damage build stacks to a cap of 30. Each stack grants 15% weapon damage. Taking damage at max stacks triggers a purge, removing all stacks and status effects, and then dropping a healing cloud, which restores 5% of max armor for 10 seconds to all allies in the cloud. And let me tell you, because of how this thing plays, it's constantly cycling and it's constantly purging. So, you're standing in a cloud of green and you're farting all over the place and leaving heals everywhere. So, let's look at the base stats here. So, we're at 2.1 million in armor or let's just call it 70% hazard protection. Well, how did I get there? Some of it's because of those roles I showed you on the build, a little bit from the watch, but a big chunk of that is coming from the modifier. Hazard protection is increased by 7.5% for each stamina tier. We have four stamina tiers. So right there is 30% hazard protection. And then when we get to tier five in stamina, we're going to get 5% protection for elites per blue core while at tier five in stamina. And then all we need to do is kill three enemies to get to tier five. That's three blue marked enemies. Well, how are we going to do that? Because we're not killers. Assists count. So, it's going to take a lot more assists to get that extra tier, but it happens. So, when you see the blue core guys, just put a couple of hits on them to make sure you get some assistance credit, but you don't have to worry about this too much. And then this final one is sort of up to you, but I took a tier day. For each tier and any attribute, gain 10% total health. Tech link. Yep, tech link, which is all about skills, skill efficiency. When you activate this, your electronics attribute is set to tier five. Check this out. For the duration of the ability, you gain 10% skill efficiency for every non yellow core equipped. So that's 10%. We got six blue cores, so that's 60% skill efficiency. Yeah, that goes to the shield. That goes to the artificer hive. Powerful. All of your attributes are frozen and bonuses are multiplied by four. We got firearm crits. You got bonus armor for every 300,000 damage you take. And you're going to be at tier four. So that's 10% bonus armor for every 300,000 damage we take. Clutch. All passive modifier values are multiplied by two. That 30% hazard protection becomes 60. And that's going to drive us to 100% hazard protection. The 60% total health turns to 120% total health. This would potentially get you to the cap, which would be 80%. If we were at max tiers, which isn't going to happen too often. So the duration for the buffs are 25 seconds and then it goes to cool down for 60 seconds. Using your active modifier is all about timing. The main reason why I'm running tech link is because I want that instant reset to all my cooldowns. So, if my shield breaks, I'm usually standing out there in the middle of nowhere. So, I like to make sure my tech link is available. So, if it does break, then I can use it and get right back in the fight. It's literally instant. The other way you can go is security link. That's going to allow you to get to that fifth tier on your armor every 60 seconds. But then if your shield breaks, you're going to have to stand by until the cooldown goes away. But this also gives you unlimited armor kits. So if you ran something like firewall, then you can play into those really amazing armor kits. Or you can run survivalist and heal your team with your armor kits, too. But you're too busy out there using your shield to take aggro. In my opinion, Techlink is the way to go because a bull work build is all about the shield. Thank you for hanging out with me.

Your boy Tux here. Hey, you know how every season in the Division 2 brings new gear and modifiers and there's always one build that stands out from the pack? Well, this season we've got a 10 out of 10 build that's got it all. Top tier damage and survivability. Last season it was the blue screen exotic LMG with the Heartbreaker gear set. That microwave coils passive modifier got you to full buff fast and it had an edge everywhere. Solo or group, heroic, legendary, even master difficulty and the climax mission. This season there's a new one taking over. It's got 100% crit chance with nearly 500% crit hit damage, almost 1,200 RPM and it's fully immune to every single hazard, even the new purple flame. Plus, it's rocking 1.9 million in armor. Bonus armor. That's off the charts. Burst DPS reaching as high as 26.5 million, which is crazy. 30 to 60% protection from elites and crazy high armor regeneration and heals that's going to save your butt. This is the build you want this season. It's ready for anything. Let's do this. Piece of [\u00a0__\u00a0] Wristwatch. We're going to start off doing something a little bit different. I'm going to do a playbyplay here on a couple of clips. moments where things get wild, where the build is really put to the test. And these are the moments where you need your build to pull through and step up to meet your skill level and support your play style so you come out with the W. And if it doesn't, maybe you go back to the drawing board. But in this one, I'm going to show you that even in Legendary, this build has your back. Everybody recognizes this room. It's about halfway through District Union Arena on Legendary. There's three healer station dudes and they always kind of stay in the back here and drop their heals in spots you can't see. So, I'm going right after them. And the first thing I want you to notice here is my bonus armor. That's crazy high. And note that I haven't even gotten a kill yet. Where is that bonus armor coming from? I'm going to show you that later. So, the rest of my team is bunkered up in the back. For a lot of this, the NPCs are isolated. It's me and them. They are supporting me, but you will see here that one of my guys goes down and another one has to revive him. So, I got two players off of the board there. So, I'm kind of flying solo here. Now, right when my guy goes down, that's where things start to get hairy. And you can't see it, but there's at least one, if not two NPCs shooting at me from the rear. And then finally, my shield breaks. And I get disorientated for a minute because hazard protection doesn't fully protect you from that. However, it does shorten its cycle. And the moment my shield breaks, I'm taking damage from three targets. But keep an eye on my armor bar cuz this is nuts. My armor and my health go all the way down. And you think I'm going to die. I thought I was. And then I'm able to pop out of cover and get back into the fight. Basically go into hyperdrive and eliminate him. Okay, here's scenario two. Basically the same thing. It's the very next room. I'm the tip of spear. I'm way out there ahead of my team. My shield can't keep up. It breaks. I lose all of my armor. But then instead of dying, I get this magic bonus armor and nobody's running tardy grade and I'm not running unbreakable or leadership or anything like that. So I make it to cover. My armor regen is strong. Buying me time to apply a very strong armor kit which helps me heal through more damage and I'm back to the fight and we slaughter him. All right, final clip real fast. This is aggro the end boss. And it's hard to tell, but he's got special ammo. So when he hits you, you usually get disorientated. But that's not happening because I'm immune. And what I also want to show you here is that his pulse I'm nearly immune to it. Okay, let's get into the build details. We got a lot to go through because the modifiers interweave themselves into the build itself. Builds are way beyond the gear pieces and primary weapons. Now, let's start with the backfire SMG. I have a little bit of expertise. I will be adding more. Have damage to targets out of cover payment in kind. That's 200% critical hit damage. Now, the catch is until you get to full stacks, every time you reload, you can apply a bleed to yourself that could eventually kill you the closer you get to 100 stacks, especially if you're taking damage from enemies. So, I highly advise making yourself immune to bleed. Now, some people like to try to run this weapon without hazard protection. It's not a question of whether you can, it's that the animation just slows down your gameplay and it's very disruptive. So, I made this quick info graphic for you. the status resistance thresholds. I advise you to take a screenshot and keep this handy for future builds, but you have to be about 94% resistance to bleed to avoid the animation altogether. If you want to take it into legendary, then disrupt resistance is really handy. For example, when a warhound blows up right next to you or you're near one of those EMP pulses, they can bring down your shield. Because of the new content in Brooklyn and the purple flame, you want to be immune to both napal and burn. Then there's everything else. And we are completely immune to every status in the game. We have 100% hazard protection. So, I've been pairing umber with the backfire for several seasons now because Umbre sort of fixes everything wrong with the backfire. It's a little on the slow side. So, this thing is going to give us an RPM boost. That's super helpful. 15% crit chance, 30% reload speed. All the mods I have are critical hit damage. The rest of the pieces, as you can see, are armor and hazard protection. and then from the shadows into the light, which is a ridiculous length of text here. So, let me just explain it. While you're in cover, you're building offensive stacks. When you get out of cover, you use the offensive stacks. At base, it's 50 stacks, but I'm running the chest piece, which pushes it to 100 stacks. I highly recommend running the chest piece with Umbra. So, that's 100 stacks of 1.2% critical hit damage. So, 120% critical hit damage and then 4% RPM per stack, which is 40% RPM. So, that pushes this to just shy of 1,200 RPMs. It takes 5 seconds for you to fill your stacks, but it takes about 1 second for the game to realize you're in cover. So, you earn your defensive stacks when you are out of cover. To use your defensive stacks, you have to go back in cover. So, you're going to get up to 50 stacks. Each stack will give you8 armor regen. So that's 80% armor regen. So you're going to get about 16% of your armor back every second with this. And that's where Umbra really stands apart. The 30% RPM lift is really good and goes straight to your DPS crit damage also. However, Striker still outperforms Umbra when it comes to damage. But in my opinion, you're not really comparing apples to apples here because Umbra is a hybrid gear set. It also provides heals. Striker is just damage and it's higher damage, but it doesn't come with heals. With the global modifiers, you're going to be able to get 100% crit chance and 466 crit hit damage. Let me explain how that happens. So, your firearms attribute is set to tier five. So, you're automatically going to get to tier five. That's going to give you 10% more crit chance on top of the build. So, I'm at 62% crit chance. That's over the cap before I activate that. So, when I turn this on, it's going to push me to tier five. So, that's plus 10% crit chance. So that 10% crit chance boost we just got, it turns into 40% crit chance. We are now at 100% crit chance. All of our passive modifiers are doubled. So here we get 25% of our crit chance value is added as critical hit damage. Since we're at 100% crit chance, 50% critical hit damage boost. For the backpack, I'm running the Momento. That's going to give us 30% weapon damage, 10% bonus armor per blue core. We have six. So that's 60% bonus armor plus 3% armor regen and 30% skill efficiency. I have a crit damage mod on it. Now for the mask, the hollow man. Don't worry if you don't have this. So it has hazard protection, armor, health damage, hazard protection, and then critical hit damage. If you don't have the yaw mask, but I suggest you do, put one of these umber pieces onto your mask and then create an improvised gear piece. Instead of putting armor and headshot damage, you want it to have hazard protection and critical hit damage. And then where I have protection from elites, stick bleed resistance there. For the specialization, I'm going with firewall. That's for the shield, which ends up being more damage. I got damage bonus, damage bonus, active regen. It is a tier six shield, and it's giving me 15% damage bonus per enemy. So, I'm dedicating this section to why this build performs really well with all armor cores because I love all red builds, too. But to get damage advantage as well as added survivability damage from all of the perks coming from the modifier system, you're going to want those armores on this one. So, if we refer back to this clip where I'm taking tons of damage, Umbra is a big contribution to why I survived this because that 16% armor regen per second was offsetting the damage I was taking about 304,000 armor back per second. To start adding things together here for a comprehensive view, then we're getting 3% armor regen from the Momento per second. That's 57,000 regen in addition to the 304,000 regen coming from Umbra. So part of what's adding to my survivability is that in this moment I have 361,000 in armor regen per second offsetting that damage. Okay, so earlier I showed you that there's this magical bonus armor that's coming up in these situations. So in this one I enter the room with all this crazy bonus armor. Now right here as you see me moving from cover to cover that bonus armor isn't coming from something like leadership. It's not adrenaline rush. It's not tardy grade. and I haven't grabbed a fresh trophy yet. Where's that bonus armor coming from? Well, it's coming from the hardcore global modifier, stamina. And another reason why you want to run lots of armor. If you're running an all red build, this is negligible. You don't even notice the bonus armor. So, what that's doing is providing bonus armor to offset the enemy's damage. And the enemies have lifted damage. Enemies marked with red gain 15% weapon damage. So, because this is six blue course, we're getting at least 2.5% bonus armor for every 300,000 damage we take. That's 47,500 or roughly 23,750 per bullet. Because of the way hardcore works, you want to run assault link. And it's one of the reasons why you want to run maximum armor for the additional power boost. This gives you 5% weapon damage for every non red core equipped. Since we have six blue cores, that means 30% weapon damage boost. And bonuses are multiplied by four. So that 47,500 bonus armor per 300,000 damage we take. Yeah, that's jumping to a whopping 190,000 bonus armor per 300k damage. The duration of earning is going to be 25 seconds. Then you go on a cool down, but there is no duration on the length you can retain the bonus armor. So, your momentos give us 60% bonus armor per blue core. Those can stack. That's 1.14 million in bonus armor for a single trophy. And we are getting our share of kills. So, we're stacking those 1.14 2.28 million and so on. So, bonus armor on top of bonus armor. All of our passive modifiers are doubled. Here, we gain 5% protection from elites per blue core while at tier five. The build starts at tier four, so we only need to kill three blue targets to get to tier five. Hazard protection is increased by 7.5% for each stamina tier. So, this happens right away. You don't have to activate anything. And that's pushing this to 100% hazard protection and opens up space on the build for critical hit damage. So, a lot of benefits for running armor cores. So, what are the benefits if we ran six red cores? Well, that's 90% more weapon damage. But when assault link is active, we get 30% more weapon damage on the blue core build. So that turns this six blue core build into a six blue core build with three red cores. So although the red core build is active all the time, we're going to have that 30% weapon damage every 60 seconds for 25 seconds. And there's a lot you can do in 25 seconds. And all red build can't take advantage of the assault link perk of 5% weapon damage for every non red core equipped. it would be better off taking the security link or tech link, but neither of these would give you more damage. Your attribute bonuses would still be multiplied by four and your passive modifiers would still be doubled, just like the all blue build. As far as passive modifiers go, well, you wouldn't really get any extra damage. You'd still be rolling loaded up, and there's no other passive modifier that rewards you for running all red on your build, except for specialized, which gives your signature weapon damage increased power. not super helpful. And I wanted to show that the momento works just fine in group play. So sometimes you hear that, hey, if you're playing in group, don't run the momento. And I get why that said because you have to be able to kill. If you're running, in this case, a DPS tank build. Your job is to get kills. So that is a little bit of a skill thing there if you struggle with contributing to kills. So if that's you, you can look at a palisades backpack or a groupo backpack with adrenaline rush on it. But with this build, the time to kill is fabulous. You just got to learn the mechanics and the in and out of cover thing, which I got to say is not for everybody. Striker is just point and shoot. But if you're tired of running striker and at the same time don't want to lose extremely effective DPS and have the added utilities that come from this build, then you got to give this one a try because we have the damage and a very efficient time to kill. But in certain situations, that whole statement, the best defense is a really good offense, doesn't always apply. Let me know what you guys think. I really hope you guys try out this build. It's a banger this season. Catch you on the next one. Thank you for hanging out with me. I'm Tuxedo Bandido.

It was a rough time for sure. The endgame was underwhelming. The balance was skewed heavily in favor of enemies. The Dark Zone was well, the Dark Zone and so on. At $15, Underground wasn't even a band-aid fix of new content. It just simply added a new activity that wasn't worth pursuing and then nerfed the G36C, my beloved, for overperforming. Fast forward to almost 9 years later with The Division 2 and Battle for Brooklyn. It's the first paid DLC since Warlords of New York launched in 2023. Timick skewing slightly negative reactions from fans. Numerous betrayals, plot twists, conspiracies, and new modes like Countdown and the Summit later. I'm finally back to where the journey began. The nostalgia doesn't quite hit without waiting in line behind other agents, but assailing the police station set to that music brought back some memories. However, the rest of the experience will feel very familiar for longtime fans. It's acceptable if you know what you're getting into, and there are some cool moments, but those expecting a breakout new experience may want to temper their expectations. [\u00a0__\u00a0] reach the head. The DLC starts with a distress call from Brooklyn as the player battles the cleaners in a bid to rescue Dr. Jessica Candle, who returns from the first game. You eventually learn that the group has some spoiler diabolical plans. This time revolving around a new damage type called Purple Flame. In between trying and failing to rescue some other minor characters, you catch up with Theo Parnell, take instructions from the rightfully angry Melanie Hoskins, and even fight the Rikers and Black Tusk, the latter with their own sinister plan. The dialogue is still somewhat hit or miss, and the facial expressions quality in some scenes, especially from Mel and Theo, undercuts them further. Even though it's really hard to feel any sense of dramatic tension, and not just because you're an unstoppable one-man army, developer Massive Entertainment tries, I'll admit, the refinery mission, which culminates in a surprise ambush on the bridge, the settlement/home base in the DLC, as you rush back to help, does feel exciting. It doesn't really lead to any lasting consequences, but it's a cool sequence of events. There are only a handful of new story missions this time, and Brooklyn as a whole, despite the new locations, is pretty small. Don't get me wrong, it's still enjoyable to roam the streets, looting containers for electronics, water, and other assorted duads to exchange for something or the other. The Division 2 is over 6 years old, and yet Massive still delivers some of the best looking postviral outbreak environments out there. From the extensive amount of graffiti and ruined structures to little details, including deer and dogs roaming the street, piled up trash bags, and numerous corpses, the attention to detail is fascinating. Outside of the environmental storytelling, discovering conversation logs, even if most aren't quite as memorable as the base games, and engaging with side activities, be it fighting patrols, stopping propaganda broadcasts, or tackling elite enemy territories, remains as enjoyable as ever. Remains is the key word here. There's barely anything new in terms of objectives or tasks. The four new control points are also fine, but I didn't really see the new promise gimmicks until the third, which had a rocket launcher turret powered by a generator that must be destroyed, which is a mechanic that appears a couple of times in the story missions as well. Again, nothing terrible or outright offensive, but it can feel repetitive. Fighting the cleaners, even the bells and whistles like seasonal modifiers and hostile modifiers feels more of the same, though the shooting still feels good as ever. The purple flame was introduced previously, but is now more common among enemies. It's a neat mechanic since it effectively reduces your maximum armor if you don't use an armor repair kit. It isn't gamechanging, which is seemingly Massive's intent for better or worse. just consider it an additional wrinkle which you may or may not care about except on higher difficulties and even then only slightly so. That same familiarity affects the main story missions, though thankfully not all of them. For the lack of originality that finding four release valves within a time limit at the refinery presents, fighting against the boss and numerous enemies while navigating the thick smoke is very atmospheric. The hunt for the Rad Queen and subsequent battle are almost also fairly harrowing, while the final mission offers an appropriately epic finale. I'm left somewhat apathetic afterwards at the Revelation, though they tie into the ongoing tale. However, the overall narrative feels like a stop gap more than a big step forward. There's new loot to chase in Battle for Brooklyn, including the measured assembly gear set, which I didn't engage with due to running solo. I can see it working well for teams relying on smart cover, which makes a return, but it did little to dissuade me from my crusader shield/ attack drone frontlining strategy. The Iinance Armament brand set, which increases threat and pistol damage, could suit that approach, though I didn't gather enough pieces to really experiment with it. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the DLC and the update as a whole is the stability. It's no secret that The Division 2 has suffered extensive crash issues on PC for years. While it seemed better the last time I played, they returned to an unbearable degree with crashes occurring anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes after booting the game up to half an hour in. I tried almost everything to fix this. verifying game files, deleting the shader cache, enabling exploit protection in Windows, turning off latency, and enabling Nvidia's fast sync, you name it. And while it improved for a while, it's since gone back to crashing in minutes. Your mileage may vary on this front, but considering the mission length, it's extremely annoying, even if you can reload at certain checkpoints. That's not possible in the open world, by the way. So, good luck. While I'm critical of how utterly safe Battle for Brooklyn is, it does offer a good amount of content for its price. There's also something to say about sticking to what works rather than introducing a new mode that ultimately won't pan out. Plus, the gameplay presentation, with some exceptions, and sound design remains solid. If you're a fan and just want some decent new content to run through, either solo or with friends alongside the new season, it does the job. However, given the progress that The Division 2 has made with its season and free updates, I was expecting a bit more from Battle for Brooklyn, and not just in terms of more story missions. They say you can always go back, but never really return home. And while I wouldn't hold Brooklyn in such high regard, it could have used a bit more to feel like a special homecoming. As it stands, this is a solid DLC offering what it says. Never outstaying its welcome or trying to be something it's not. Hey, did you know that we at Gaming Bolt upload new videos every day?

Without you, it'll burn."}, {"source": "YouTube: The Division 2 Battle for Brooklyn DLC is an ABSOLUTE JOKE", "content": " So, um, yeah, I've had to bring the warrants back because the Division 2 Battle for Brooklyn DLC sucks. And I mean, it's bad. So, this DLC cost me $12.99 Great British pounds. And I got Louis to grab it with me as well. And we ran through this entire DLC, every single main and side mission in 2 1/2 hours. And there's a bunch of different things I want to talk about. There's a couple of clips I actually want to show you. So, we will be switching up a little bit from the wall ranting, but it'll only be for like a few seconds when I'm like I basically want to put the footage on screen to show you what happened. I'm I'm going to start with the boss's names in this. I I just don't get there. There's no creativity from anyone in the current development team for this game. And I'm probably going to say this a few times throughout this video, but this DLC took them around 2 years to develop. I did a video saying year five season 4 was going to see the launch of the DLC and I estimated that I'd launched somewhere around March 2024. So they were showing signs of the DLC being ready for launch over a year ago. Then it got delayed. They said it wouldn't launch until 2025 and I think they put somewhere around April for it to launch. Then they had to do yet another delay and they've launched it at the end of May. And in all that time, some of the boss' names, you've got Bombshell, you've got Mug Boy, you've got Rat Queen, and then there's a mission called the Art Museum. So, they've named one of the bosses in there Vinnie Gooff and the other one Monet. They could not come up with any names. So, in an art museum, I I get it. It's fitting, but they've used famous artists as boss names. They just kind of switched it up a little bit so that there's no copyright issues or whatever it might be. And next up, I want to talk about the season just very briefly because I couldn't care any less about their recycled rubbish. The start of the Crossroads Manhunt, which is like the seasonal manhunt, it has you going back to DC. It says go back for some target practice. So again, cuz I'm pretty sure they did it with Warlords. They haven't utilized the new map for the beginning of the new season. And it just it makes no sense. None of this DLC makes sense. There's going to be spoilers and stuff possibly from like here up to the end of the video. So, if you don't want spoilers, if you want to go play it for yourself, do that. Then come back and watch the video. But basically, a character we killed or we thought we had killed in Warlords, Theo Parnell, later in time, he's now working with us because they wanted to show I this is why I'm confused. And if any of you can let me know, then please let me know in the comments. They wanted to show the reason they've set this in autumn is because they wanted to show time passing. So, that means it's set later than anything else we've done. correct or or am I misreading that somewhere? But what they've done is Theopo Parnell in Warlords I I don't even know when Warlords was supposed to be set, but Theop Parnell was a rogue agent, so he took him down and then all of a sudden in the Battle for Brooklyn, he's working with us. Even though he's still not work, he's not a full ally. He's manipulating us at the same time and stuff. I I just don't get it. It would make a lot more sense if Battle for Brooklyn is supposed to be like a prequel, but then it wouldn't make sense because Ken's dead in the DLC. Now they did this whole like deep fake cutscene thing with Kina in this and that there's no talks of him outside of that really. But even if they portrayed it so that Ken is still alive during this DLC, we have his stupid ass watch that's got this horrible voice. And then the next thing is there is one new skill and one new exotic in the entire DLC. And I say that because there are multiple exotics, but how do you get your hands on them? Seasonal content. you know that stuff that is recycled for the last 5 years. That's how to obtain the other stuff through natural progression of the DLC running the missions and things like that. You have one new skill and one exotic and then they've got like gear set brand set the typical they do. And I don't know if you guys will remember back to the video I did talking about the showcase and like basically revealing stuff to do with the DLC. They were absolutely buzzing that they had added wear and tear to Candle's ID badge. You could really see how time had affected her by looking at her ID badge. Yeah, the ID badge that you get to see for about two minutes at the beginning of the DLC and then during a single cut scene at the end, you get a brief look at it. Other than that, you won't get to see Candle. You'll be out doing missions and stuff. So, for that to be a talking point was pathetic. And then what's even worse is a lot of people have been complaining in reviews and stuff on Steam at least. Oh, and I think even on their Twitter threads that they're currently ignoring, people still can't access the DLC. This was a seven hour downtime for this to launch and it was tied in with a 17.5 gig update for this tiny tiny DLC by the way. And yeah, hours and hours later, people still can't access it. And what makes it even worse, the people that have bought the gold or the ultimate edition that has the DLC, they can't access it. It's still telling them they need to buy the DLC, but they've bought the new ultimate or gold edition, they're supposed to come with the DLC and they can't access it. And then getting into a couple of issues that were actually in the DLC. This is going to be the first clip. You are going to see the lighting which was really really nice at the beginning of the DLC. So it shows how well it was tested. You'll see all I have to do is move forwards and it goes nighttime or daytime. I move backwards. It does the same thing. I can't remember which order. You guys will see in the footage, but yeah, simply all I have to do is move a little bit like say move 5 m and it changes from night to day in the click of your fingers. And that happened for Lewis as well. So, I'm going to guess it's a widespread issue. It It was just It was bizarre going from night to day in like a couple of footsteps. And then back to the wall rant. We'll uh we'll carry on to the next thing. Sweeping for hostiles. If there was a drinking game, have a shot every time you see the objective to sweep for hostiles. I would probably need my stomach pumped to the hospital. It's ridiculous how much they repeated that objective throughout this DLC. And then to make things even worse, we're going to go back to another clip. There's a decontamination door as well. There's actually a couple. They take forever to open, but when they do open, you uh have the ability to get stuck in them. And I got stuck. I was combat rolling for a minute or something. Couldn't get out of it. Then all of a sudden, it teleported me back inside the door and I had to wait for the whole process to go ahead again. And then me and Lewis wiped when we respawned. I got stuck in the door yet again because for some reason these decontamination doors haven't been coded properly. They don't open if you're in co-op. Like it will look as though they're opening but then they'll just close on you. You'll get stuck in them. And then as I said earlier in the video, like back to the wall rant and I think that's going to be it for like the rest of the video is going to be the wall rant. Um but yeah, there's no Isaac in this DLC. You hear him every now and then for a couple of sentences. Instead, we've got this really annoying AI sounding woman. And I mean, she she's got the voice of some one you would hear on like Babe Station. Like, it's horrible to listen to this voice just constantly saying objectives, like giving us tasks and stuff to do. I want I wanted Isaac back. I hated Isaac. He was that piece of wristwatch in one of the missions in the base game, but I really wanted Isaac back. This woman did my absolute nut. And I don't think I'm the only one that's going to get frustrated with that voice either. it. This sounds like AI. And then some of the worst things of this DLC, the mechanics, the missions seven and eight are by far the worst. And they're supposed to be the the climax. They're supposed to be the end of the DLC. So yes, there are going to be like spoilers on bosses and stuff here, but I mean, it's a 2 and 1/2 hour DLC. You could probably stretch it to three, possibly 4 hours if you're really taking your time. Me and Louis weren't even rushing this. We were just doing the missions. But yeah, in mission, I think it's mission seven, you have to take down the rat queen. She's not Well, I say take down, you're supposed to apprehend her, and she's got raid boss mechanics. She's got this like the bubble shield sort of thing you would see in Halo. And what you need to do is go around to these generators, interact with them, wait a moment, and her shield comes down. You can deal some damage, and then guess what? Shield comes back up, interact with some more generators, take them down, and you can finish her off. Like you can you can kill her, but then the whole objective is to apprehend her. There's no like getting her down to like one HP and then triggering a cut scene where you capture her and send her off to the base of operations or whatever. You straight up kill this woman and then it tells you, \"Oh, we've apprehended her. We're sending in the the recovery team or whatever, like her vital signs are stable or whatever they said.\" But it's stupid that they put raid boss mechanics in a story DLC. And then the absolute best thing because there was one good thing in this DLC. They made a Zeppelin. They made one and it was quite cool for part of it. It did get bad. But yeah, by far just seeing the Zeppelin for the first time was the best thing in the DLC. And we didn't even get to take that down. We had to just wait and wait and wait for these SAM turrets to come online. And then the Zeppelin was shot down in a cutscene. And what what does the Zeppelin do? You you would think something new Zeppelin. You don't see it in the in the Division 2. That's going to be a cool ass main boss, but it's not. All that thing does is drops drones like Razerback does in the raid. What we got as a final boss, the final thing to take down was a marauder. You know, them big like quadcopter drone things, the chase you around Washington. Yeah, they're back because I I don't get where the Black Tusk fit into this. You would like I get it, Black Tusk. They're a faction in the game, but they had more screen time in this DLC than the major factions of this DLC. They had two years to make this DLC and the final boss was something we've already done before. It was a marauder. We've taken them down lots. We've gone for propaganda broadcasts and after finishing it, there's a random marauder that spawns in. You got to take it down before you get killed. All the Zeppelin did was fly off like it dropped some drones that were from Razerback. it flew off and got shot down. That that was it. That that was the climax of the DLC. And talking about the Black Tusk, we saw them as much as we saw the Rikers. Whereas the cleaners, which were being spoken about as a major talking point of this DLC, they were barely even there. This DLC, one of their talking points was the purple flames that the cleaners had started using. We saw more purple flames come out of turrets than we did out of cleaners. And the cleaners were barely even there. It was I spent more time killing Rikers and Black Tusk than I did cleaners. And as well as the uh you know we spoke about the sweeping for hostiles, a lot of the objectives were rinse and repeat as well. Most of the time we were either disabling a turret by shooting the generator thing or we were shooting a valve on a wall or twisting a valve so that we could stop some of the purple flame stuff and move on to the next area. And then the bridge settlement. It's not even a base of operations. It's not a boo. It's just a stupid little settlement that you got as a bonus sort of working area in the base map. but it's the most convoluted settlement we've ever seen in the franchise. Trying to find your way out of that place can be a nightmare and it just it doesn't need to be. And then the absolute best thing uh yeah, get your abacus out, your little VTEC xylophone things, all your little like baby like toddler toys because what they've done is they've got a global modifier called hardcore and what it does is makes these colored shapes come up above enemies heads and there's no way to turn them off so that you can't see them. You're either going to get a what is it? A yellow square, a red No. Yeah, I think it's a yellow square, a red triangle, and a blue circle or something like that. And they'll just pop up at random and and give you these stupid buffs. And uh yeah, have fun because that's a seasonal modifier. So, it's going to be around for at least 3 months. Have fun seeing that on your screen all the time. If there was a way to just disable it off your HUD, like to just take it off your HUD, it would have been fine. But no, them the colored shapes are stuck on your screen at all times. And I mean, they've gone is one of your favorite things from The Division. Well, the amount of time we spent in underground subways during this DLC. The the where is the underground mode? Where's Survival? Where's we even went to appear? Where's Resistance? They've they've basically kicked every Division fan in the teeth. They've just teased, oh, we've done this stuff from Division One, but you're not actually getting anything good from the Division One. We're just going to take you to a div one area and just bring back their memories, but not let you relive them, experience them in the Division 2. No, if you want to do that, go play Division One again. And yeah, as I said, they've worked on this for 2 years. They're charging $12.99. This should have been free. This should have been a seasonal update. There is no thing in this world that warrants this to have a price tag on it. There is nothing that can justify or validate that price tag. This should have been a seasonal update. The map is tiny. The missions are pathetic. The bosses, it's all rinse, repeat content, and they've locked stuff behind the seasons. The developers that are currently working or that did work on this DLC. What they've done is an absolute joke. I've not been this disappointed with a DLC for a very, very long time. But yeah, that's uh going to be my rant over. That's my thoughts on the Battle of Brooklyn. And uh yeah, it's probably going to be at least another couple of years until I come back to the game. Or what they could do is give us Division 3. I I would like a brand new fresh start in the series. It would have been, do you know? It would have been absolutely perfect. Now they're done with Star Wars Outlaws and Avatar. It would have been perfect for the climax. like you explode the zeppelin and then there's like fireworks to come out of it or something and it's got some sort of a reveal or something about the Division 3. They they could have done anything. We even had there was an explosion at the end of one of the levels which is just a reminder of the gas tank exploding when you drop it in Division 1. This time you just drop a shipping container on a ship, it explodes and gives you purple flames instead of your typical flames. They they copied so much stuff. did nothing good with it at all. And yeah, they're disappointed is an understatement. What a complete waste of money and time, even though it is barely any time, 2 and 1/2 hours. But yeah, that's my thoughts and opinion and everything. Let me know what you think about this DLC in the comments, and I will see you guys in the next video. I hope you enjoyed"}, [{"source": "Wikipedia: Tom Clancy's The Division 2", "content": "Tom Clancy's The Division 2 is a 2019 online-only action role-playing video game developed by Massive Entertainment and published by Ubisoft. The game, which is the sequel to Tom Clancy's The Division (2016), is set in a near-future Washington, D.C., in the aftermath of the release of a genetically engineered virus known as \"Green Poison\" and follows an agent of the Strategic Homeland Division as they try to rebuild the city. Like its predecessor, The Division 2 is a third-person shooter in which the player uses weapons and gadgets to fight enemy factions. The game features elements of role-playing games (RPGs) and has cooperative and player-versus-player online multiplayer modes.\nMassive Entertainment worked with Ubisoft Reflections, Red Storm Entertainment, and Ubisoft's studios in Annecy, Paris, Bucharest and Shanghai to create the game. The developers evaluated feedback from players of the first game and decided to have more-robust endgame content at launch. They explored other cities as the game's setting, ultimately choosing Washington, D.C., due to its diverse environments, landmarks and monuments that could be recreated. The developers were inspired by real-life disasters while creating the game's post-apocalyptic world and consulted first responders and experts in emergency management. Tom Clancy's The Division 2 was released for PlayStation 4, Windows and Xbox One on March 15, 2019. \nCritics gave Tom Clancy's The Division 2 generally favorable reviews, with most noting it as an improvement over the first installment for its setting, gameplay, visuals, combat, level design and wealth of content at launch, though its narrative received criticism. Like its predecessor, the game was a commercial success, selling over 10 million copies worldwide despite not meeting expectations at launch. The game was nominated for Best Multiplayer at the annual The Game Awards and BAFTA Game Awards. As a live service game, Ubisoft supported it with downloadable content (DLC) packs and free updates. The company later released an expansion pack, Warlords of New York, in March 2020. A second expansion, Battle for Brooklyn was released five years later in 2025. As of late 2024, a sequel titled Tom Clancy's The Division 3 is in development.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nThe Division 2 is a cover-based third-person shooter in which up to four players can complete missions together. The game takes place in Washington, D.C., seven months after the events of its predecessor Tom Clancy's The Division, in which a civil war between survivors and villainous bands of marauders breaks out. At the beginning of the game, players create their own Division agent by customizing the character's gender and appearance. The agent is equipped with explosives like grenades as well as firearms, including assault rifles, sniper rifles and submachine guns; these weapons are classified into tiers and rarity. High-quality guns are difficult to obtain but have better weapon statistics and \"talents\" that help boost players' performance. Weapons can be further customized with attachments like firearm optics, iron sights and barrel attachments. The game also features a variety of gear and armor; wearing gear from the same brand gives players a small performance boost. \nAs players complete missions, they gain loot and experience points (XP). With sufficient XP, they level up and gain SHD Tech, a currency that is used to unlock new skills, including the deployment of gun turrets, shields and combat drones, or gaining access to weapons like seeker mines and chemical launchers. Each skill has unique mods that change its functionality. The game introduces new types of enemy, including healers and characters who shoot foam at players. During missions, players can request backup, which allows other players to join their sessions. Players can join a clan that can accommodate up to 50 players. The actions of individual clan members contribute to clan XP, which can be used to upgrade the clan for additional gameplay benefits.\nWashington, D.C., is an open world for players to explore. Players can recruit non-playable characters (NPCs) by completing missions and providing supplies to settlements. Recruiting NPCs unlocks projects that reward players with gear, XP and blueprints for crafting. Upgrading settlements enables their expansion to include more facilities and gives players benefits such as access to their gear stash or fast travel. Discovery of a safehouse reveals the location of nearby SHD caches and additional fast travel points. Players can liberate enemies' control points and call civilian reinforcements to assist in battle, participate in world events, such as stopping public executions and capturing resource convoys, and searching for collectibles including comms, relics and Echoes. Players encounter weapon vendors who buy trinkets (unusable \"junk\" items players collect) and unwanted gear in exchange for E-credits, the game's currency, for purchasing new weapons, crafting and appearances changes.\n\n\n=== Dark Zones and endgame content ===\nThe Division 2 features three Dark Zones, where players defeat tough enemies for valuable and rare loot, though the loot can be taken by other players. Each Dark Zone supports up to 12 players. Upon entering a Dark Zone, players' gear become normalized to ensure all players are on equal terms. Non-contaminated loot belongs to players once it is collected but contaminated loot must be extracted by a helicopter while players defend the extraction point from artificial intelligence (AI) enemies and other players. When one player breaks into a Dark-Zone chest or steals a Dark-Zone supply drop, the player and their team will become rogue. Rogue players can attack other players in the same session to steal their loot and gain XP. Once they eliminate another player, they become \"disavowed\", which alerts other non-rogue players. If the disavowed rogue eliminates more players, they become a \"Manhunt Rogue\" and players who kill the rogue agent will receive a significant bounty. Rogue status can be removed by surviving in the Dark Zone for a period of time or accessing the Thieves' Dens (for rogues) and Manhunt terminals (for Manhunt rogues). The Dark Zone has its own progression system called DZ XP, which is earned by killing enemies and rogues, and can be used to unlock perks and gameplay advantages such as a reduced rogue timer. The Division 2 also includes a traditional competitive multiplayer mode named Conflict, which players can compete against each Skirmish, Domination and other modes. Conflict maps are set in standalone locations that are not contiguous with the main open-world map.\nWhen a player reaches level 30 and finishes the game's campaign, the game-world is divided into \"world tiers\", which serve as thresholds for further increasing the game's difficulty. Player levels are replaced by Gear Score, which is calculated using the statistics, attributes and talents of all of the player's weapons and armor. In the endgame, a new enemy faction named Black Tusk invades D.C. and randomly selects three previously completed missions or strongholds as operational targets, reactivating them as invaded locations. Invaded locations have tougher enemies and correspondingly better loot. By completing Invaded missions and having a sufficient Gear Score, players can liberate a stronghold to unlock the next world tier. Players can encounter 52 bosses, collectively known as the Deck of 52; each boss will drop a collectible card for players once they are defeated. Players can unlock more skills by specializing their character to a specific class. Each specialization has a signature weapon; the Survivalist uses a crossbow, the Sharpshooter wields a TAC-50 anti-materiel sniper rifle, and the Demolitionist uses a M32A1 grenade launcher. Post-launch updates introduced the Gunner, who can use a portable minigun; the Technician, who is equipped with a missile launcher; and the Firewall class, who wields a flamethrower. Players can enter Occupied Dark Zones in which weapons are no longer normalized, friendly fire is activated, AI enemies become more difficult to kill and players are no longer notified when other players turn rogue. The game features raids, which are extended combat challenges that can be completed by up to eight players,\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n\n=== Setting ===\nIn 2015, in response to the chaos and unrest caused by the outbreak of the Green Poison epidemic depicted in Tom Clancy's The Division in New York City, the United States government activated a secret contingent of domestic sleeper agents under the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD or \"the Division\") to preserve order and continuity of government. Division agents use advanced technology, have wide autonomy to deal with threats and are supplemented by the Intelligent System Analytic Computer (ISAC), an advanced AI system that manages their technology and communications nationwide.\nBy 2016, law and order have mostly collapsed after the Green Poison became a global pandemic. Most of the U.S. government's leadership is dead or missing, and the acting U.S. President Andrew Ellis is missing and feared dead after Air Force One is shot down in Washington, D.C. The city is now lawless and has been divided into territories by five factions: the White House-based Joint Task Force (JTF), consisting of police, fire and rescue, National Guard, disaster response organizations and volunteers, attempts to protect civilians and re-establish order; the Civilian Militia, a loose militia that supports the JTF and is based in settlements across the city; the Hyenas, a loose coalition of gangs, criminals and anarchists based in the District Union Arena who take advantage of the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors of severe quarantines based on Roosevelt Island who seek revenge on those they deem responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the True Sons, based in the Capitol\u2014an organized, ruthless group of disgruntled and corrupt JTF, U.S. military and paramilitary mutineers who believe order can only be restored through brutal authoritarianism.\n\n\n=== Plot ===\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Division agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when ISAC suddenly shuts down. The player Agent receives a Division distress call from Washington, D.C., as a new, larger force begins to attack the JTF's settlement. At a fellow agent's urging, they abandon the battle to travel to D.C. and help the JTF fend off an attack by the Hyenas. Manny Ortega, the city's Division controller, briefs the Agent and informs them of the situation in the city. Ortega instructs the Agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to assist civilian settlements, liberate the city from criminal factions, and restore ISAC.\nOrtega and Kelso uncover information about a cure to Green Poison that might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash but is being held prisoner. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to find Ellis, but Ortega notes his security clearance may be needed to access the cure. The Agent eventually rescues Ellis from the Hyenas. Ellis confirms the existence of broad-spectrum antivirals that cure Green Poison and all viral infections, but he can only access them with a special briefcase in the Capitol, which is occupied by the True Sons. After the Agent fully restores ISAC, reconnecting Division agents across the country, Ellis vows to restore the United States at any cost. The Agent, JTF and the Civilian Militia assault the strongholds of the Hyenas, True Sons and Outcasts, killing most of their leadership and allowing the recovery of Ellis' briefcase.\nAs the Agent and the Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced private military company Black Tusk, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis suddenly goes missing with his briefcase, forcing the Agent to search for him and repel Black Tusk. The Agent eventually learns Black Tusk has supplied weapons to the city's gangs and was responsible for sabotaging ISAC; Furthermore, the Agent discovers that Ellis has been working with Black Tusk and that Ellis' predecessor, President Mendez, did not die by suicide as previously believed, but was assassinated by the Secret Service detail on Black Tusk's orders. Thanks to Ellis, Black Tusk gains possession of the broad-spectrum antivirals and plans to move them out of the city. The Agent raids Black Tusk's stronghold at Tidal Basin, retrieving the antivirals and preventing a missile strike on the White House, but Ellis' location remains unknown.\n\n\n=== Warlords of New York expansion ===\nThe Agent and Kelso travel to New York City to answer a distress call from Faye Lau, leader of local Division operations. They find the JTF and Division's base in City Hall has been devastated by \"Eclipse\", a lethal variant of Green Poison the rogue Division agent Aaron Keener and his allies created. The Agent, Kelso, Lau and JTF leader Roy Benitez regroup at Haven, a civilian settlement run by Paul Rhodes, who reluctantly permits their presence. The settlement is under constant attack and harassment from the Cleaners and the Rikers, a group of sadistic Rikers Island escapees who now work as arms traffickers.\nBecause Keener's whereabouts are unknown, the group pursues his four lieutenants, rogue Division agents who act as warlords in Lower Manhattan, operating from The Tombs, Two Bridges, Battery Park and the New York Stock Exchange, respectively. The Agent eliminates the four warlords and recovers intelligence placing Keener on Liberty Island. The Agent and Kelso commandeer a ferry to Liberty Island, but are attacked by Black Tusk, who have arrived in Manhattan to attack Keener and confiscate his work. The Agent fights off Black Tusk to reach Keener inside the Statue of Liberty Museum, where they learn Keener plans to use a surface-to-surface missile to infect Manhattan with Eclipse, killing everyone, to allow Keener's own new society to flourish. The agent destroys the system and mortally wounds Keener, who activates a signal on his modified Division wristwatch before dying.\nKeener's signal activates ANNA, an AI analog of ISAC the now-dead warlord Parnell developed to network and coordinate rogue Division agents across the country. Lau, who is revealed to have betrayed the Division to ally with Black Tusk, assures Black Tusk commander Bardon Schaeffer that ANNA will help them defeat the Division. Back in Haven, Rhodes and Benitez thank and congratulate the Agent but lament Lau's betrayal. Kelso tells the Agent a rogue-agent cell has been activated in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== Development ==\nMassive Entertainment developed the game in collaboration with Ubisoft Reflections, Red Storm Entertainment and Ubisoft's studios in Annecy, Paris, Bucharest and Shanghai. The developers evaluated feedback from players of the first game and included more game content at launch. The game's endgame development was prioritized; the studio was surprised at the speed at which players consumed the base game of The Division and were left with nothing to do. The endgame in The Division 2 was designed to be more robust and to further enhance replayability. The Black Tusk's invasion offered a different set of challenges from the main game as their AI was designed to be more aggressive and coordinated than other factions. The developers listened to the community's wishes, introducing more character-customization options and including post-launch updates from the first game at the sequel's launch. The game world was designed to be more lived in; players can trigger emergent events by exploring the game's world. To differentiate The Division 2 from the first game in the series, the developers redesigned the game's weapons, mod system and class specializations.\nMassive considered setting the sequel in New York City or moving it to another major U.S. city, such as Seattle or New Orleans. It eventually chose Washington, D.C., as the game's main setting. The developers described the D.C. map as a one-to-one recreation of the city. They used the Geographic Information System and lidar data to create the floor plan of the in-game map. The developers said Washington, D.C., offered a diverse set of environments, allowing players to engage in more-varied firefights. The Division 2 has six biomes while its predecessor has only two. Unlike the city blocks of New York City, the spaces in Washington, D.C., were designed to be open and spacious; this prompted the developers to improve the enemy AI, which could now use the terrain to its advantage, flank the player and behave more aggressively. The diverse environment also enabled more-varied level design, the incorporation of natural cover and the inclusion of more interior spaces.  The developers made several visits to the city for location research and spoke with its residents to capture the \"soul\" of the city.\nBecause The Division 2 is set seven months after the outbreak of a pandemic, Washington, D.C., is in a state of despair, much more so than New York City in the first game. Areas have flooded due to failing infrastructure, and vegetation has begun to reclaim parts of the city. Massive consulted with botanists, first responders and experts in emergency management. The team also took inspiration from real-life disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, while creating the game's post-apocalyptic world. The developers wanted to explore ways civilians organize themselves during times of adversity, and the player's role is to help rebuild these communities. The developers used environmental storytelling to explore events that occur during the seven months of crisis. D.C. was chosen to raise the story's stakes, being an important symbol of power and nationhood. The depiction of national monuments in ruins create powerful imagery to indicate a complete collapse of society. Ubisoft repeatedly said The Division 2 is \"apolitical\" and that it did not intend to convey any political message through the game. \n\nMain missions in the game are set in iconic locations and at major monuments such as the White House, the Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum. The developers also crafted spaces players would be unlikely to visit in real life, such as a Cold War bunker in one mission. The game's main factions are Hyenas, a gang of \"opportunistic raiders\"; True Sons, a ruthless paramilitary organization led by former JTF officers; and Outcasts, former prisoners who seek revenge for their mistreatment. Each faction has a distinct combat AI to better establish its identity. Both the player character and enemies in the game will die in a shootout much more quickly than those in the first game because the developers wanted gameplay to be more intuitive and more akin to that of a tactical shooter. Gunplay was designed to be impactful; the developers created more-elaborate and more-visible combat animations.\nThe developers placed a larger focus on player-versus-player competitive multiplayer than they did with the first game. The Dark Zones returned in The Division 2, though they were designed to attract to a larger pool of players. Gears normalization was implemented to ensure all players can fairly compete, though Occupied Dark Zones were created for players who prefer the first title's gameplay style. While all of the loot collected in a Dark Zone in the first Division game always requires helicopter extraction, second-tier \"non-contaminated loot\" was introduced to make the experience more rewarding and less punishing. The three Dark Zone locations are Washington Union Station, the D.C. waterfront and Georgetown, with each map supporting different playstyles. Because Dark Zones are set in uninhabited areas, the developers went to Chernobyl to record its quietness in an attempt to create an unsettling atmosphere. The Dark Zones were placed in opposite ends of the map so they can be expanded in future updates. Efforts to entice PvE players to try out Dark Zones were made: the developers rewarded common PvE actions such as stealing supply drops and redesigned Rogue status system. Checkpoint camping was discouraged because defense systems in each Dark Zone will automatically attack players with the highest Rogue status.\n\n\n== Release ==\nUbisoft announced Tom Clancy's The Division 2 on March 9, 2018, and premiered the first gameplay footage at the E3 2018 in June that year. At the Expo, Ubisoft confirmed the game would be released on March 15, 2019, for PlayStation 4, Windows and Xbox One. A private beta was launched prior to the game's release, starting on February 7, 2019, and ending four days later on February 11. Another four-day open beta for the game started on March 1 the same year. The game was released as an exclusive for the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft's Uplay store. It was later released for Steam on January 12, 2023. The game, including all expansions to date, was launched on Google Stadia on March 17, 2020; this version shares cross-platform play with PC users and shared progression between those platforms. The game was also made available on Amazon Luna on November 23, 2020.\nThe Division 2 was billed as a live service video game, which Ubisoft would support with free updates following its initial launch. After the game's release, three episodes of downloadable content (DLC), which add new story content and gameplay modes, were released. Players who purchased the Year 1 Pass received those episodes early and gained access to several missions known as \"Classified Assignments\". The first episode, which is titled D.C. Outskirts: Expedition, was released in July 2019 and introduces two new campaign missions in which players search for the missing president and eliminate the leader of the Outcasts, and a three-part expedition set in Kenly College, where the Division must reach a lost convoy with valuable supplies. The second episode, titled Pentagon: The Last Castle, was released in October 2019; this DLC adds two new missions based in The Pentagon and a DARPA research laboratory. In this episode, the Division and Black Tusk agents race against each other to discover a secret in the defense headquarters. The last episode, Coney Island: The Hunt, was released in February 2020; in this episode, the player must search Coney Island for a scientist who may have found the cure for the virus that caused the global pandemic.\nIn March 2020, Massive released Warlords of New York, the game's first paid expansion pack that raised the level cap to 40, though new players can directly access the expansion as a level-30 character. The expansion closed the story arc established in the base game and its subsequent episodes. It reintroduced two factions from the first game, the Rikers and the Cleaners, and featured a new map based in hurricane-ravaged Lower Manhattan, divided into four districts. Additionally, the expansion introduced new gadgets, an overhaul of the gear system, more-varied boss fights and global events, which are gameplay modifiers.\nIn 2025, a second New York-themed expansion was released, titled Battle for Brooklyn. The release added new missions and a map expansion with two new neighborhoods in Brooklyn, which paid homage to the opening sequence of the first Division game.\nStarting from the game's second year of release, the game adopted a seasonal model, with Ubisoft releasing manhunt targets and gameplay events over a 12-week season. Post-launch support was set to end by late 2020 as Massive shifted its attention to Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws. Warlords of New York was more successful than the developers had anticipated, prompting Massive and its co-development partner Ubisoft Bucharest to release more seasons and updates for the game. The developers had to re-run seasons in 2021 and early 2022 before the first major update, \"Season 9: Hidden Alliance\", was released in May 2022. As of December 2024, Ubisoft is still supporting the game; \"Year 6 Season 1 First Rogue\", the latest season, was released in June 2024.\nA number of game modes were introduced following the game's initial release; Ubisoft also released the first raid named \"Operation Dark Hours\" in May 2019. Ubisoft described the raid, which is set in Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, as the biggest challenge for all The Division 2 players, requiring eight players to cooperate with each other and complete a series of objectives. The second raid, titled \"Operation Iron Horse\", was released in June 2020. On September 22, 2020, Ubisoft released a new game mode named \"The Summit\" in which up to four players work as a team and ascend a 100-story skyscraper, combating increasingly difficult enemy forces. Season 9 introduced \"Countdown\" in which a team of four must attempt to stabilize a failing nuclear power station within 15 minutes. In April 2023, the developers introduced the \"Descent\" mode, which is set in a training simulation; up to four players, either playing solo or together, must complete a series of encounters starting with basic weapons. In the mode, which borrows mechanics from roguelike games, players gradually became more powerful as they acquire talent points. Ubisoft experimented with a battle royale mode that was later reworked into The Division Heartland, which was canceled in 2024. Ubisoft also released cosmetic items and weapons skins based on other franchises such as Resident Evil and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 received \"generally favorable reviews\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The expansion pack Warlords of New York also received generally favourable reviews with the exception of the PS4 version, which received \"mixed or average\" reviews.\nChris Carter from Destructoid praised the game for its tight satisfying gunplay, and he was impressed by the responsiveness of the game's artificial intelligence. Johnny Chiodini from Eurogamer noted the game significantly expands on the foundations that are established in the first game, introducing new gadgets and interesting changes to customization and gears. Matt Bertz from Game Informer praised the more-impactful gunplay, noting enemies can be defeated much more quickly than those in the first game but called the cover system \"finicky\". GameSpot's Edmond Tran said the wide range of enemy types forces players to quickly adopt different tactics and called game's combat tense and exciting. The game's progression system, which regularly rewards players with new gadgets and gears, was also praised. Critics also praised the design of the game's missions and levels, singling out gameplay segments set in landmarks and monuments of Washington, D.C. Massive's digital recreation of Washington, D.C. was praised; Tran called the setting an \"engrossing, believable, and contiguous open world\", and James Duggan from IGN praised Massive's attention to detail that invites players to explore. Writing for PC Gamer, Samuel Roberts wrote that D.C. is much more dynamic than, though not as recognizable as, New York City in the first game. According to Chiodini, the sunny D.C. location is not as atmospheric as snowy New York. \nThe endgame also received positive reviews; Carter praised its replayability, noting it reuses locations from the campaign. He remarked that Black Tusks as an enemy faction is fierce and that the endgame provides ample opportunities to explore builds and prompts players to work cooperatively. Chiodini described Black Tusks as a very aggressive faction and said reaching the endgame section of The Division 2 feels like \"a genuine step up, rather than the start of a long and dreary grind\". He also praised the incorporation of world tiers to further increase the game's longevity. Bertz praised Massive for incorporating new gameplay objectives in the endgame and said the core gameplay loop keeps players engaged and invested from the campaign to the endgame. Tran praised the wealth of activities in the endgame and said remixed missions create new combat scenarios that are progressively more challenging. Tran described Dark Zones as \"fascinating\", saying it \"adds additional facets of tension, distrust, and dishonesty\" to the game. Roberts noted the three Dark Zones are differently designed and are capable of creating tense, player-generated stories. Duggan expressed his disappointment, saying the sequel lacks the dynamic of the first game. Many critics praised The Division 2 for being feature-complete and having a stable performance at launch.\nThe game's narrative was criticized. Carter noted the game lacks a strong story and is filled with forgettable characters and faceless enemies. Tom Hoggins from The Daily Telegraph called the story \"wafer-thin\" and said the game is thematically uninspiring despite its evocative setting. Bertz praised the game's environmental storytelling but was disappointed that Massive failed to explore the pandemic and the fall of the US in any meaningful way in the main story. Tran shared similar views, noting \"the opportunity to use The Division 2 to create meaningful fiction is wasted.\" Chiodini described the story as \"awful\" and criticized the writers for evoking a \"sense of poignancy\" without exploring any political themes. He added the game \"pulls in these bits of American history with unwavering earnesty and yet manages to say absolutely nothing.\" Aaron Riccio from Slant Magazine wrote the game symbolizes the regression of the Tom Clancy's brand, a franchise that once dealt with \"complex geopolitical entanglements before turning to a modern-day fetishization of guns and violent, paramilitary engagement.\"\n\n\n=== Sales ===\nOn the week of its release, Tom Clancy's The Division 2 was the UK's best-selling game, although its sales figures were 20% of the original game's launch-week sales. In Japan, approximately 63,817 physical units for the PlayStation 4 were sold during its launch week, making Tom Clancy's The Division 2 the best-selling game of any format. In the U.S., it was the best-selling video game of March 2019 and the ninth-best-selling game of the year, according to the NPD Group.\nUbisoft's decision to not release Tom Clancy's The Division 2 on Steam at launch caused six times the number of players to preorder the game on Ubisoft Store compared with its predecessor. The game's sales on consoles failed to meet Ubisoft's expectations; the company cited increased competition in the genre as a cause of game's disappointing performance. Ubisoft added the sales on PC were similar to that of the first game. Tom Clancy's The Division 2 sold more than 10 million copies during the eighth generation of video game consoles. \nDuring testimony in the antitrust lawsuit Epic Games v. Apple it was revealed between May 9 and 11, 2019, 70\u201390% of the online transactions for the game's downloads were fraudulent; scammers were using stolen credit-card numbers to buy Ubisoft games in the Epic Games Store, which prompted a \"profuse\" email apology from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. According to Sweeney: \"Fraud rates for other Epic games store titles are under 2% and Fortnite is under 1%. So 70% fraud was an extraordinary situation.\"\n\n\n=== Awards ===\n\n\n== Sequel and spin-offs ==\nAs of September 2023, a sequel titled Tom Clancy's The Division 3 is in development with Julian Gerighty serving as the game's executive producer. Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland, a free-to-play spin-off, entered development in 2020 but was canceled in 2024. Tom Clancy's The Division Resurgence, a free-to-play game for Android and iOS, is expected be released in Ubisoft's 2025 fiscal year.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"}], {"source": "Custom Wiki: Tom Clancy's The Division 2 | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Tom Clancy's The Division 2\nCompanies\nDevelopers\nMassive Entertainment\nRed Storm Entertainment\nUbisoft Reflections\nUbisoft Annecy\nPublisher\nUbisoft\nDirector\nJulian Gerighty\nMathias Karlson\nComposer\nOla Strandth\nDetails\nEngine\nSnowdrop\nPlatforms\nPlayStation 4\nPlayStation 5\nXbox One\nXbox Series X|S\nPC\nAmazon Luna\nRelease Date\nMarch 15, 2019\n\u201c\nJoin The Division, an elite group of civilian agents, and save a country on the brink of collapse as you explore an open, dynamic, and hostile world in\nWashington, D.C.\n- Description\n\u201d\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n(referred simply to as\nThe Division 2\n)\nis a tactical shooter action role-playing video game developed by\nMassive Entertainment\nas a sequel to\nTom Clancy's The Division\n.\nAn eight-player raid and three free story-driven DLCs were announced during the E3 2018 reveal.

The virus has now spread to Washington, D.C. During the initial phase of the crisis, important personnel such as POTUS, Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff and other important politicians were being evacuated. The chaos of the virus began with attacks on the Pentagon, The National Mall and other landmarks. Riots followed the day after and the security forces were hit, forcing them to evacuate the capital. The dense heatwave added to more problems. The supply lines were cut off; after a few days survivors developed communities and many of them were armed, while the criminals have developed their own factions and raid these communities for supply and control. Factions like the\nTrue Sons\n, a group of paramilitary warlords bent on dominating their enemies and expanding their territory around Washington, D.C. These militants are led by a former\nJTF\nofficer\nAntwon Ridgeway\nwho, along with those that follow him, are a force to be reckoned with. Because of this,\nDirective 51\nhas been activated in Washington, D.C. and thus activates\nDivision agents\nwho launch a joint operation with the\nCivilian Militia\nin D.C. in order to recapture the capital.\nWashington, D.C. has been recreated to be as authentic as possible complete with well-known landmarks and buildings. Despite the possible controversy, Ubisoft has stated that the choice of location was not one of politics despite the fact the chosen location is the nation's capital.\nCombat will be similar to the original game, with a few new features which include new skills and new weapons. Players who help the citizens in D.C. may find some willing to take up arms and join the fight.\nPlot\nMain article:\nStory (The Division 2)\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several\nStrategic Homeland Division (SHD)\nagents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and communications, suddenly shuts down and they receive a Division distress call from Washington, D.C. The player\u2019s agent makes their way to the city where The Division and the remains of the local Joint Task Force have set up their Base of Operations in The White House. After defeating an attack on the White House shortly after arriving in the city, the agent is briefed on the general situation by\nManny Ortega\n, The Division controller for D.C. The agent learns that much of the city is under the control of three main enemy factions: the\nHyenas\n, a loosely organized group of several gangs, criminals, and anarchists who seek to take advantage of the chaos, the\nOutcasts\n, a fanatical group made up of the survivors of the Roosevelt Island quarantine zone, whom seek to exact revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection, and the\nTrue Sons\n, a highly organized and ruthless group of former Joint Task Force personnel, paramilitaries, and other traitors who seek to gain control over the entire capital. Ortega instructs the agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to help assist civilian settlements, fight the various enemy groups, and restore the SHD Network. Meanwhile, Ortega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of Air Force One and is being held by one of the city's factions. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to rescue Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure.\nThe agent continues to work to liberate city districts and eventually manages to find and rescue Ellis from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that a cure to not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exists but he can only access it with a special briefcase he had with him on Air Force One. However, the briefcase is in the possession of the True Sons who are holding it in their main base at the United States Capitol. With the Capitol too fortified to assault yet, the agent works to strengthen The Division's forces while continuing to weaken the other factions. Eventually, the agent is able to restore the SHD Network, connecting all Division agents nationwide, restoring the power and advantages of the Strategic Homeland Division to all agents across the United States. With the tide turning against them, the various factions retreat to their final strongholds - the\nDistrict Union Arena\n,\nRoosevelt Island\n, and the\nUnited States Capitol\n. Victories in each stronghold break the factions up and remove their leadership permanently, leaving the factions disorganized and in disarray.\nHowever, as the agent and The Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced private security contractor\nBlack Tusk\n, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis goes missing, leaving the agent to head out once again to repel the Black Tusk invasion. During this time, ECHOs reveal that the Black Tusk was responsible for the shutting down of the SHD Network and that they had been planning an invasion long before the agent had arrived, supplying arms to the Hyenas and what not. Similarly, the invasion causes mass chaos in D.C., with formerly liberated areas suddenly becoming hot zones and the settlements coming under threat once again. Despite this, the agent fights through each and every landmark once again, eventually somewhat stabilizing the situation in D.C., and is able to access the Broad-Spectrum Antivirals, apparently hidden in the Ellipse Complex near The White House. It is there that the agent discovers that Ellis had actually handed the Antivirals over to Black Tusk and that they are now being held at\nBlack Tusk's Tidal Basin Headquarters (in West Potomac Park)\n.\nFollowing this, the agent launches an ambitious invasion to finally remove the Black Tusk from D.C. by attacking Tidal Basin, as well as recovering the antivirals. The mission nearly ends in disaster, with desperate Black Tusk leadership attempting to launch a missile at The White House, but the agent eventually prevails, recovering the antivirals. Despite this, D.C. remains in total disarray, with four major hostile factions now jostling for power over the city in various different ways, while President and traitor Andrew Ellis remains missing.\nFeatures\nSpecializations\n- End game content that allows players to continue character and weapon progression with elite weapons and skill trees.

Bush\nSignature\nDirective 51\nis a presidential arrangement from 2007, that promises an assurance of specific rights in a catastrophic emergency. It was written and signed by President George W. Bush on May 4, 2007. This emergency describes a location independent incident that threatens the American people, infrastructure, environment and political functions.\nIf another operation like\nDark Winter\nwas conducted there is a possibility that an organization such as\nThe Division\nwill be activated in order to not only restore government control but to also save of what remains of society.\nDespite Directive 51 being kept a secret, information about its existence was leaked, and reporters like\nRick Valassi\nwere actively investigating it.\nThe nonclassified elements of Directive 51 specify that, in the event of a catastrophic emergency, all governmental power will be transferred to the president, top advisers and a committee including:\nVice President\nNational Security Advisor\n: senior aide in the executive office of the president, serving as the chief in-house adviser to the president on national security issues.\nNational Continuity Coordinator (NCC)\n: the directive specifies that the assistant to the president for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism will be designated as the national continuity coordinator. The NCC would be tasked with ensuring the continuity of all \"national essential functions\" (federal, local, territorial, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations) through a National Continuity Implementation Plan (NCIP).\nContinuity Policy Coordination\nCommittee (CPCC)\n: the CPCC is to be responsible for coordinating the NOC's NICP. It's to be chaired by a senior director from the Homeland Security Council staff, designated by the NCD.\nContents\n1\nCentralization of Power\n2\nIn Real Life\n3\nGallery\n4\nAppearances\nCentralization of Power\nPrior to Directive 51, a catastrophic emergency would have been handled according to the National Emergencies Act (NEA). The NEA allowed the president to declare a state of emergency, but also gave Congress the power to \"modify, rescind, or render dormant such delegated emergency authority,\" if it deemed that he'd acted inappropriately.\nHowever, Directive 51 effectively supersedes the NEA, through the appointment of the NCC, without any specific act of Congress authorizing the position. It also negates any requirement that the president submit to Congress a determination that a national emergency exists.\nFurthermore, the U.S. Constitution states that the three main branches of the federal government (executive, legislative and judicial) must be kept equal and separate, with no single branch coordinating the others. Under Directive 51, the executive branch effectively takes a leading role, coordinated by the president.\nIn Real Life\nDirective 51 also known as\nNational Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive\nwas written and signed on May 4, 2007. The law also gives American citizen's specific rights in a catastrophic emergency. The law was signed after\nOperation Dark Winter\nalso caused the collapse of society by creating a mock simulation of a smallpox outbreak in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and additional cases in Georgia and Pennsylvania.

Stinger micro-drones also cause some enemies to bleed and\u00a0flail about while they are under attack from the hive, preventing them from attacking or taking other actions.\nThe micro-drones on the Stinger variant glow the iconic Division orange.\nWhen the Restorer Hive detects missing armor on a friendly Agent in its range, it deploys micro-repair drones towards the Agent. On impact, an amount of armor is repaired.\nThe micro-drones on the Restorer variant glow a bright green.\nThe Booster Hive enhances Agents by sending out micro-drones that administer stimulants to increase their combat efficiency \u2014 boosting weapon handling, movement and other physical capabilities of the Agent by roughly 20%. Booster stimulants last for 20 seconds.\nThe micro-drones on the Booster variant glow a slightly dim yellow.\nWhen deployed, the Reviver Hive can revive allies within a specific radius on the ground. Unlike the other variants, Reviver Hives are not autonomous and must have their micro-drones manually activated by the Agent; an Agent can also charge up the micro-drones to increase the health and armor an ally revives with. Reviver Hives will also deploy automatically and revive an Agent carrying one if they are downed, so long as the hive is not cooling down. However, Reviver does not work during Conflict Mode\nThe micro-drones on the Reviver variant glow a very light shade of blue.\nExclusive to the new \"\nTechnician\n\" specialization, the Artificer Hive shoots out fast-acting micro-drones to deployed skills (including other Hives), repairing them,\u00a0temporarily boosting their performance/damage, and extending their duration.\nThe micro-drones on the exclusive Artificer variant glow the Dark Zone purple.\nModifications\nHives have three mod slots: System, Launcher and Drones.\nSystem\nmods improve cool-down times or charges.\nLauncher\nmods improve cool-down times, damage or the hive's health.\nDrones\nmods improve effect durations, damage or the hive's duration.\nGallery\nRestorer Hive\nStinger Hive\nReviver Hive\nBooster Hive\nArtificer Hive\nAn Agent using the Hive on an enemy\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nSHD Technology\nPulse\n\u2022\nSticky Bomb\n\u2022\nTurret\n\u2022\nSeeker Mine\n\u2022\nBallistic Shield\n\u2022\nChem Launcher\n\u2022\nDecoy\n\u2022\nDrone\n\u2022\nFirefly\n\u2022\nHive\n\u2022\nTrap"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Title Update 22 | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Title Update 22\nis an update that was released for\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\non October 20, 2024.\nContents\n1\nShades of Red\n2\nSeasons 2.0\n2.1\nSeasonal Journey\n2.2\nSeasonal Modifiers\n2.3\nPriority Objectives\n3\nManhunt Scouts\n4\nGear, Weapons and Talents\n4.1\nNew Exotic Weapon\n4.2\nNew Exotic Gear\n4.3\nNew Gear\n4.4\nNew Named Weapons & Talents\n4.5\nNew Difficulty: Master\n5\nRework and Updates\n5.1\nBalancing Existing Gear\n6\nUpdated Loot Pool\n6.1\nNamed Weapons\n7\nOther\n8\nFriend Referral\n9\nSeason Pass\n10\nOne Time Offer\nShades of Red\nYear 6 Season 2: Shades of Red is marking the start of a new seasonal journey. With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.\nSeasons 2.0\nSeasonal Journey\nThe new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.\nThe entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.\nSeasonal Modifiers\nThe Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience:\nGlobal Modifiers set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop.\nThis season, the theme is \"range.\" The Global Modifier, \"Point Blank,\" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies.\nActive Modifiers function like \"ultimate\" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power.\nPlayers can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier.\nPassive Modifiers work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses.\nPlayers can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier.\nHostile Modifiers: These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities.\nAs players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them.\nThe modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges.\nPriority Objectives\nThe Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.\nPlayers can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.\nIf none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.\nThere is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.\nManhunt Scouts\nManhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.\nEach week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.\nOnce all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.\nBy the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.\nGear, Weapons and Talents\nThis season introduces two new Named Weapons and several new Talents, along with a new Gear Set and Brand Set. Exotic collectors can look forward to a new Exotic Assault Rifle, an Exotic Holster, and an exclusive Exotic Chest Piece awarded for completing the Climax Mission.\nNew Exotic Weapon\nTalent Unnerve\nKilling and enemy will apply a mark on every enemy within 20m of it.

Once a gleaming symbol of urban redevelopment, this sprawling complex of skyscrapers, luxury residences, and cultural hubs has become a microcosm of the chaos gripping the city.\nSafe House: Kerman Station\nRespawn Point\nSocial Area\n1x Weapons Vendor\n1x Player Stash\n1x Lootable Object\n1x Restock\nContents\n1\nPre-Pandemic Hudson Yards\n2\nThe Green Poison Outbreak\n3\nHudson Refugee Camp\n4\nAppearances\nPre-Pandemic Hudson Yards\nBefore the\noutbreak\n, Hudson Yards was the largest private real estate development in U.S. history, a $25 billion project that reshaped Manhattan's West Side. It featured iconic structures like The Vessel, a honeycomb-like sculpture, and towering glass skyscrapers housing corporate headquarters, high-end retail, and exclusive condominiums. The area was a magnet for the elite - financiers, tech moguls, and global influencers - boasting cutting-edge smart technology and sustainable design. It's proximity to the\nHudson River\nand\nPenn Station\nmade it a vital transportation and economic hub, pulsing with ambition and wealth.\nThe Green Poison Outbreak\nWhen the\nGreen Poison\nswept through\nNew York City\n, Hudson Yards was hit hard. The virus, spread via contaminated currency during\nBlack Friday\n, turned the bustling retail concourses into ground zero for infection. Crowded holiday shopping events at\nThe Shed\nand the luxury stores accelerated the spread, and within days, the area was a ghost town. The affluent residents fled or barricaded themselves in their high-rise penthouses, while the working-class staff - security, maintenance, and service workers - were left to fend for themselves.\nAs the city collapsed, the federal government activated the Strategic Homeland Division (\nSHD\n), deploying agents to restore order. However, Hudson Yards became a flashpoint for competing factions vying for control of it's resources and strategic position.\nHudson Refugee Camp\nWhen the\nvirus\noverwhelmed\nManhattan\n, the\nJTF\nand\nCivilian\nauthorities established a refugee camp in the\nHudson Rail Yards\n, hoping to shelter and treat infected civilians. The camp, featured in the \u201c\nHudson Refugee Camp\n\u201d medical mission, was a desperate attempt to contain the\noutbreak\nand protect survivors. Dr.\nJessica Kandel\n, a key figure in the\nMedical Wing\nof the\nBase of Operations\n, saw the camp as a vital resource for collecting blood samples to research a cure.\nHowever, the camp quickly descended into chaos.

With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.\nSeasons 2.0\nSeasonal Journey\nThe new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.\nThe entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.\nSeasonal Modifiers\nThe Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience:\nGlobal Modifiers set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop.\nThis season, the theme is \"range.\" The Global Modifier, \"Point Blank,\" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies.\nActive Modifiers function like \"ultimate\" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power.\nPlayers can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier.\nPassive Modifiers work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses.\nPlayers can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier.\nHostile Modifiers: These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities.\nAs players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them.\nThe modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges.\nPriority Objectives\nThe Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.\nPlayers can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.\nIf none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.\nThere is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.\nManhunt Scouts\nManhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.\nEach week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.\nOnce all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.\nBy the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.\nGear, Weapons and Talents\nThis season introduces two new Named Weapons and several new Talents, along with a new Gear Set and Brand Set. Exotic collectors can look forward to a new Exotic Assault Rifle, an Exotic Holster, and an exclusive Exotic Chest Piece awarded for completing the Climax Mission.\nNew Exotic Weapon\nTalent Unnerve\nKilling and enemy will apply a mark on every enemy within 20m of it.

Joint Task Force.  A militia formed in the wake of the collapse of the Washington, D.C. JTF and the rise of the True Sons, Hyenas, and Outcasts, this militia seeks to maintain their settlements' independence and promote non-violent survival.\nContents\n1\nGameplay\n2\nEquipment\n3\nMilitia Types\n4\nQuotes\n5\nGallery\n6\nTrivia\n7\nReferences\nGameplay\nIf the player decides to help the militia with various tasks like gathering food and supplies, the militia can be called in a battle to assist the player in capturing control points around the city.\nAfter a battle, militia officers might ask the player for some medications, food, water, and components. The Civilian Militia also guard the exterior of the White House with the help of\nJTF\noperatives. Civilian Militia members are also seen at different parts of the city patrolling and scavenging for items they want to bring back to their settlement. They are however not a united faction, being dispersed into many groups in various locations.\nEquipment\nThe civilian militia have access to a vast array of scavenged weapons, but little equipment.\nTheir weapons vary widely, ranging from older shotguns and revolvers favored by Outcasts, to SMGs and pistols favored by the Hyenas, to high quality assault rifles and LMGs favored by the True Sons.\nThey have a limited access to secondary equipment, as most seem to favor WW2 era sling rigs, as well as hand torches and limited access to police equipment.\nMost have limited combat training, as they display better tactics and equipment than the Outcasts or Underground, but are outmatched by better equipped enemies such as the Hyenas, or better trained opponents such as the True Sons.\nMilitia Types\nMilitia Soldiers - Militia soldiers make up the bulk of the Militia force. Armed with various weaponry (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns) they are most commonly seen capturing control points, patrolling areas, scavenging for supplies, and delivering supplies to control points and their respected settlement.\nMilitia Officers - Officers usually lead their squad into battle when taking over a control point and are seen training new recruits in target practice. Armed with only a pistol, they are the only member of the Militia that can revive agents if they are downed. They are usually indicated by a green star marker.\nSettlement Guards - Sentry Guards are usually stationed at the entrances at their respected Settlements, protecting the entrances from hostiles, and are usually the ones to open up the entrance when they see a Division agent approaching.\nControl Point Guards - Guards armed with various assault rifles. They are stationed around the perimeter around their control point, engaging in hostiles that are patrolling through and defending their control points from hostiles that want to capture it. If the control point has a mounted weapon, CP Guards will be the first to man it.\nScouts - Militia members armed with various marksman rifles and high-range binoculars. They are seen on platforms that have high altitude, recon the area for special nodes that have much needed supplies and check the streets for hostile patrols. Usually they are alone, but sometimes have another member on the ground for backup.\nRushers - Militia members armed with an ax or a baseball bat, they are only seen rescuing hostages and/or taking over control points. They are rare to spawn.\nQuotes\n\u201c\nHere!  Take some of this shit!\n- A female Civilian Militia agent in a random attack quote against hostiles.\n\u201d\n\u201c\nCome on, people!

The virus has now spread to Washington, D.C. During the initial phase of the crisis, important personnel such as POTUS, Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff and other important politicians were being evacuated. The chaos of the virus began with attacks on the Pentagon, The National Mall and other landmarks. Riots followed the day after and the security forces were hit, forcing them to evacuate the capital. The dense heatwave added to more problems. The supply lines were cut off; after a few days survivors developed communities and many of them were armed, while the criminals have developed their own factions and raid these communities for supply and control. Factions like the\nTrue Sons\n, a group of paramilitary warlords bent on dominating their enemies and expanding their territory around Washington, D.C. These militants are led by a former\nJTF\nofficer\nAntwon Ridgeway\nwho, along with those that follow him, are a force to be reckoned with. Because of this,\nDirective 51\nhas been activated in Washington, D.C. and thus activates\nDivision agents\nwho launch a joint operation with the\nCivilian Militia\nin D.C. in order to recapture the capital.\nWashington, D.C. has been recreated to be as authentic as possible complete with well-known landmarks and buildings. Despite the possible controversy, Ubisoft has stated that the choice of location was not one of politics despite the fact the chosen location is the nation's capital.\nCombat will be similar to the original game, with a few new features which include new skills and new weapons. Players who help the citizens in D.C. may find some willing to take up arms and join the fight.\nPlot\nMain article:\nStory (The Division 2)\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several\nStrategic Homeland Division (SHD)\nagents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and communications, suddenly shuts down and they receive a Division distress call from Washington, D.C. The player\u2019s agent makes their way to the city where The Division and the remains of the local Joint Task Force have set up their Base of Operations in The White House. After defeating an attack on the White House shortly after arriving in the city, the agent is briefed on the general situation by\nManny Ortega\n, The Division controller for D.C. The agent learns that much of the city is under the control of three main enemy factions: the\nHyenas\n, a loosely organized group of several gangs, criminals, and anarchists who seek to take advantage of the chaos, the\nOutcasts\n, a fanatical group made up of the survivors of the Roosevelt Island quarantine zone, whom seek to exact revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection, and the\nTrue Sons\n, a highly organized and ruthless group of former Joint Task Force personnel, paramilitaries, and other traitors who seek to gain control over the entire capital. Ortega instructs the agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to help assist civilian settlements, fight the various enemy groups, and restore the SHD Network. Meanwhile, Ortega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of Air Force One and is being held by one of the city's factions. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to rescue Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure.\nThe agent continues to work to liberate city districts and eventually manages to find and rescue Ellis from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that a cure to not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exists but he can only access it with a special briefcase he had with him on Air Force One. However, the briefcase is in the possession of the True Sons who are holding it in their main base at the United States Capitol. With the Capitol too fortified to assault yet, the agent works to strengthen The Division's forces while continuing to weaken the other factions. Eventually, the agent is able to restore the SHD Network, connecting all Division agents nationwide, restoring the power and advantages of the Strategic Homeland Division to all agents across the United States. With the tide turning against them, the various factions retreat to their final strongholds - the\nDistrict Union Arena\n,\nRoosevelt Island\n, and the\nUnited States Capitol\n. Victories in each stronghold break the factions up and remove their leadership permanently, leaving the factions disorganized and in disarray.\nHowever, as the agent and The Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced private security contractor\nBlack Tusk\n, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis goes missing, leaving the agent to head out once again to repel the Black Tusk invasion. During this time, ECHOs reveal that the Black Tusk was responsible for the shutting down of the SHD Network and that they had been planning an invasion long before the agent had arrived, supplying arms to the Hyenas and what not. Similarly, the invasion causes mass chaos in D.C., with formerly liberated areas suddenly becoming hot zones and the settlements coming under threat once again. Despite this, the agent fights through each and every landmark once again, eventually somewhat stabilizing the situation in D.C., and is able to access the Broad-Spectrum Antivirals, apparently hidden in the Ellipse Complex near The White House. It is there that the agent discovers that Ellis had actually handed the Antivirals over to Black Tusk and that they are now being held at\nBlack Tusk's Tidal Basin Headquarters (in West Potomac Park)\n.\nFollowing this, the agent launches an ambitious invasion to finally remove the Black Tusk from D.C. by attacking Tidal Basin, as well as recovering the antivirals. The mission nearly ends in disaster, with desperate Black Tusk leadership attempting to launch a missile at The White House, but the agent eventually prevails, recovering the antivirals. Despite this, D.C. remains in total disarray, with four major hostile factions now jostling for power over the city in various different ways, while President and traitor Andrew Ellis remains missing.\nFeatures\nSpecializations\n- End game content that allows players to continue character and weapon progression with elite weapons and skill trees.

Players can either choose to play on their own or join a squad of up to 4 players.\nUrban Jungle\nNew York City is being overrun by hostile groups trying to take advantage of the crisis.

With Aaron Keener in custody at the White House, he aims to strike a deal with The Division. Before Agents can learn what he knows, they have to secure the other members of Keener's team, starting with Theo Parnell.\nSeasons 2.0\nSeasonal Journey\nThe new Seasonal Journey introduces a structured progression system with 7 sequential missions, each containing 8 objectives. It is designed to guide players through the early stages of each new season, offering a mix of challenges and goals that introduce key mechanics. Available from level 1, even new players can jump right into the current season's content.\nThe entire Seasonal Journey unlocks at the start of the season. As you complete each mission and objective, you'll earn various rewards, including XP, Season Pass XP, progression-boosting items, resources, and active modifiers. Completing the entire journey will grant you a unique cosmetic item.\nSeasonal Modifiers\nThe Seasonal Modifiers are central to each season's unique gameplay, spicing up the usual rules and mechanics of the game. There are four distinct types of modifiers, each playing a crucial role in shaping player experience:\nGlobal Modifiers set the overall theme of the season and are active at all times while the system is enabled, affecting the core gameplay loop.\nThis season, the theme is \"range.\" The Global Modifier, \"Point Blank,\" grants a bonus damage based on distance from enemies.\nActive Modifiers function like \"ultimate\" abilities, giving your character a short burst of power.\nPlayers can choose from a selection of Active Modifiers, but only one can be equipped at a time. This season, they manipulate the range zones set by the Global Modifier.\nPassive Modifiers work in conjunction with the Global Modifier, adding extra bonuses.\nPlayers can equip up to three Passive Modifiers simultaneously. In the first season, these modifiers provide additional benefits based on the range zones from the Global Modifier.\nHostile Modifiers: These represent how the enemies adapt to your new abilities.\nAs players progress through the season, enemies will gradually gain new abilities linked to specific enemy types, forcing you to use the Global, Passive, and Active Modifiers strategically to counter them.\nThe modifier system can be disabled at any time and is mutually exclusive with global events, allowing players to control how they engage with the seasonal challenges.\nPriority Objectives\nThe Priority Objectives system offers a variety of short-term objectives, enhancing the way players can farm for items and resources in the game. The Priority Objectives system becomes available upon reaching level 30.\nPlayers can choose from three objectives, selecting one based on limited information such as duration, reward category, and mission type. Once a selection is made, it is locked in, and the full details of the objective and its rewards will be revealed.\nIf none of the objectives appeal to the player, the system allows for rerolls and has an Abandon Objective feature. Players can earn reroll points by completing Priority Objectives, with a maximum of three rerolls stored at any time.\nThere is no limit to the number of Priority Objectives a player can complete, and rewards include XP, Season Pass XP, items, resources, and passive modifier unlocks.\nManhunt Scouts\nManhunt Scouts is a new system that drives the game's narrative by requiring players to complete weekly activities that reward them with equipment, XP, materials, and, most importantly, new collectibles.\nEach week, players can tackle a Scout, which consists of three different activities. These activities will vary, and players must solve a small riddle to complete each one. Activities should be completed in order, and once all three are finished, players will receive the Scout Reward.\nOnce all activities in a Scout are completed, players will receive a bigger reward, including a unique collectible. However, new Scouts cannot be accessed until the current one is completed.\nBy the end of the season, completing all Scouts unlocks the Manhunt Climax Mission, and finishing that unlocks the Master Climax Mission, so make sure to stay on track each week.\nGear, Weapons and Talents\nThis season introduces two new Named Weapons and several new Talents, along with a new Gear Set and Brand Set. Exotic collectors can look forward to a new Exotic Assault Rifle, an Exotic Holster, and an exclusive Exotic Chest Piece awarded for completing the Climax Mission.\nNew Exotic Weapon\nTalent Unnerve\nKilling and enemy will apply a mark on every enemy within 20m of it.

There is a Safe House hidden in practically every district in\nManhattan\n, but an individual can locate one by looking for the white circle painted on a nearby wall, occasionally with an arrow within pointing in its direction. There are two basic types of safe house: those in\nManhattan\n(the Light Zone) and those in the\nDark Zone\n.\nNormal Safe Houses are locations set up and manned by the\nJTF\nto provide localized support to personnel in the field, as well as basic/temporary shelter for some civilians. Safe houses serve as a base of operations for each district; each one is a safe zone, which means that weapons and skills are disabled. Unlike the outside world, players can see other players that are not members of their group. Players can recruit one another from these Safe Houses either by selecting them in person, or using a matchmaking terminal present.\nEach normal Safe House contains various amenities and points of interest, including:\nA resupply crate that refills ammo,\nFrag Grenades\n, and\nMedkits\nfor free.\nAccess to the player's\nStash\n(extended storage container).\nA gear vendor or weapon vendor who sells items for\nCredits\n.\nA situation board that, when first accessed, will place all\nEncounters\nand\nSide Missions\nfor that district on the player's map. When a district is fully completed, that situation board becomes the source and turn-in location for Search and Destroy missions.\nA resident\nJTF Officer\nthat serves as your guide for side missions within that district. Upon completion of all side missions in that district, the officer will give the player an extra reward.\nA boombox that plays music and an episode of Rick Valassi's\n\"Wouldn't You Know It\"\n.\nThere are also safe houses within the Dark Zone, though they are run by individual Division agents rather than the JTF. Unlike normal safe houses, the only amenities available in a Dark Zone safe house are one or two Dark Zone vendors and a resupply box; the vendor(s) barters in\nDark Zone currency\nfor high-level items. Also unlike normal safe houses, Dark Zone safe houses have multiple entrances and exits to discourage players from griefing one another. Furthermore, a player is unable to use fast travel to move between safe houses or to leave the Dark Zone - fast travel is disabled in the Dark Zone's interior, in general.\nThe\nCheckpoints\non the\nDark Zone\n's perimeter count as safe houses to an extent, as they all act as safe zones and provide fast travel locations, a respawn point and a resupply box, while most also provide the stash, a Dark Zone vendor, and a kiosk to check the Dark Zone leaderboards. Note that if a player is carrying contaminated items in a Dark Zone checkpoint and attempts to fast travel, the game will warn that those items will be destroyed (the same as if they attempted to walk back into the Light Zone with contaminated items on their person). Additionally, players cannot see other players not in their group inside a checkpoint; if a player not in the group enters a checkpoint from inside the Dark Zone, they will disappear from sight.\nSafe Houses\nSafe House\nDistrict\nLocation\nLevel\nVendor\nJTF Officer\nPlymouth Rock\nBrooklyn\n139th Plymouth St\n1-4\nGear\nMartin Hazen\nKerman Station\nHudson Yards\nWest 34th St and Hudson Blvd East\n5-9\nWeapons\nJB Keller\nThe Cavern\nGarment District\nWest of West 34th St and 7th Ave\n5-9\nGear\nBryce Thompson\nThe Meat Locker\nTenderloin\nEast of West 24th St and 7th Ave\n9-12\nWeapons\nSimon Kapornick\nDante's Run\nHell's Kitchen\nEast of West 42nd and 10th Ave\n10-13\nGear\nKelly Garcia\nAutumn's Hope\nTimes Square\nEast of West 49th St and Broadway Ave\n10-14\nGear\nWinston Jefferson\nWolves Den\nClinton\nSoutheast of West 52nd St and 9th Ave\n14-15\nWeapons\nSammy O'Hara\nMadison's Stand\nFlatiron District\nEast 29th St and Madison Ave\n15-16\nGear\nAnthony Zappa\nThe Last Call\nGramercy\nWest of East 20th st and 1st Ave\n16-18\nWeapons\nSuzie Broughn\nThe Ward\nStuyvesant\nSouth of East 23rd St and Avenue C\n18-19\nGear\nSam Johnson\nSouthpaw\nKips Bay\nNorthwest of East 29th St and 1st Ave\n20-23\nGear\nPaul Aguilar\nThe Grindhouse\nMurray Hill\nWest of East 38th St and 3rd Ave\n24-26\nWeapons\nAlbert Gutnick\nThe Firewall\nTurtle Bay\nEast 43rd St and 2nd Ave\n27-28\nGear\nLissa Montelli\nThe Crypt\nMidtown East\nEast of East 52nd St and Madison Ave\n28-30\nWeapons\nTeresa Lopez\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: ECHOs | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "This page is about the collectible, for the technology, see\nECHO\nTom Clancy's The Division ECHOs\nTom Clancy's The Division 2 ECHOs\nThe\nEvidence Correlation Holographic Overlay system\n, or\nECHOs\nfor short, are holographic reconstructions created by the\nISAC\nsystem by using audio-video recordings from local security and communication feeds.

Bush\nSignature\nDirective 51\nis a presidential arrangement from 2007, that promises an assurance of specific rights in a catastrophic emergency. It was written and signed by President George W. Bush on May 4, 2007. This emergency describes a location independent incident that threatens the American people, infrastructure, environment and political functions.\nIf another operation like\nDark Winter\nwas conducted there is a possibility that an organization such as\nThe Division\nwill be activated in order to not only restore government control but to also save of what remains of society.\nDespite Directive 51 being kept a secret, information about its existence was leaked, and reporters like\nRick Valassi\nwere actively investigating it.\nThe nonclassified elements of Directive 51 specify that, in the event of a catastrophic emergency, all governmental power will be transferred to the president, top advisers and a committee including:\nVice President\nNational Security Advisor\n: senior aide in the executive office of the president, serving as the chief in-house adviser to the president on national security issues.\nNational Continuity Coordinator (NCC)\n: the directive specifies that the assistant to the president for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism will be designated as the national continuity coordinator. The NCC would be tasked with ensuring the continuity of all \"national essential functions\" (federal, local, territorial, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations) through a National Continuity Implementation Plan (NCIP).\nContinuity Policy Coordination\nCommittee (CPCC)\n: the CPCC is to be responsible for coordinating the NOC's NICP. It's to be chaired by a senior director from the Homeland Security Council staff, designated by the NCD.\nContents\n1\nCentralization of Power\n2\nIn Real Life\n3\nGallery\n4\nAppearances\nCentralization of Power\nPrior to Directive 51, a catastrophic emergency would have been handled according to the National Emergencies Act (NEA). The NEA allowed the president to declare a state of emergency, but also gave Congress the power to \"modify, rescind, or render dormant such delegated emergency authority,\" if it deemed that he'd acted inappropriately.\nHowever, Directive 51 effectively supersedes the NEA, through the appointment of the NCC, without any specific act of Congress authorizing the position. It also negates any requirement that the president submit to Congress a determination that a national emergency exists.\nFurthermore, the U.S. Constitution states that the three main branches of the federal government (executive, legislative and judicial) must be kept equal and separate, with no single branch coordinating the others. Under Directive 51, the executive branch effectively takes a leading role, coordinated by the president.\nIn Real Life\nDirective 51 also known as\nNational Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive\nwas written and signed on May 4, 2007. The law also gives American citizen's specific rights in a catastrophic emergency. The law was signed after\nOperation Dark Winter\nalso caused the collapse of society by creating a mock simulation of a smallpox outbreak in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and additional cases in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The directive is highly controversial as it allows a single branch of government to coordinate with the others.\nGallery\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division\nTom Clancy's The Division 2"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Agent St. Clair | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "This article,\nAgent St. Clair\n, has insufficient information and needs more content.

Dark Zone\n.\n\u201c\nThe Dark Zone is a place for wolves and not sheep.\n- Description\n\u201d\nThe\nDecontamination Zones of the District of Columbia\n, colloquially known as the\nDark Zones of D.C.\n, are\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n's\nversion of the open Player Versus Player (PVP) zones with some Player Versus Environment (PVE) elements tied-in.\nThe Dark Zone is an untamed area of the map where any agents can go off the grid to do terrible things. The Dark Zone is also the most dangerous area in the game, where fear, betrayal, and tensions are high, as any other agent can turn against you and steal your hard-earned loot.\nThe Dark Zone is per design an area that provides many challenges. The NPCs you meet are brutal \u2013 but the biggest challenge has always been the other players. While the DZ used to have a lot of features to make the DZ more PVE player-friendly, with\nTitle Update 8\nmany of these changes were reversed and the Dark Zone became more focused on PVP.\nContents\n1\nDark Zone Story\n2\nGameplay\n2.1\nNormalization\n2.2\nGoing Rogue\n2.3\nDark Zone Checkpoints\n2.4\nInvaded Dark Zones\n2.5\nLandmarks\n2.6\nExtractions\n2.7\nSafe Rooms\n3\nDark Zone Rank\n4\nDZ Supply Drops\n5\nDark Zones Areas\n5.1\nDark Zone East\n5.2\nDark Zone South\n5.3\nDark Zone West\n6\nDark Zone Vendors\n7\nGallery\n8\nTrivia\n9\nAppearances\nDark Zone Story\nConsequences of DC-62\nIn the early days of the\noutbreak\n, the government attempted to eradicate the\nvirus\n. When these attempts failed, they walled off the most contaminated areas to try to quarantine them. In these newly established Dark Zones, an experimental chemical was deployed to try to help. This chemical (named\nDC-62\n) was a massive failure, ending up being just as lethal as the virus. This left large areas of the Capital uninhabitable and caused many looters and factions to not risk entry. That meant that high-tier weapons and gear were left behind and are now up for grabs by anyone who is willing to enter. Unfortunately, some of this gear is contaminated and must be extracted to be cleaned before it can be used. Any agent who is nearby and has questionable loyalties may decide that they'd rather have the loot for themselves and go rogue in an attempt to claim it.\nGameplay\nThe Dark Zone is the only location in which players can roam solo or in a group in an openly PVP environment without limits. In the Dark Zone, players will be able to do challenges, landmarks, take down enemy faction bosses for loot. Similar to\nTom Clancy's The Division\n,\nplayers will need to extract the contaminated loot before it can be used in the open world.\nNormalization\nIn the Division 2, the three Dark Zones in Washington D.C. utilize \"normalization\" to level the player field. Normalization reduces the peaks and valleys between players who have high survivability or high damage output. Normalization only affects Base Amor and Weapon Damage. AI are not exempt from normalization either; they adhere to the same normalization rules players do.\nMatchmaking in the Dark Zones occurs in two separate brackets. On the one side, players are matched in level buckets (1-10, 11-20, and 21-30) and normalized to the same power level. On the other side, all players who have reached World Tier are matched together and normalized to the same World Tier. For players above the normalized power level, bonus statistics are applied to reward you for your time.\nGoing Rogue\nPlayers can choose to go\nRogue\nto engage in PvP activities with other players.\nDark Zone Checkpoints\nDark Zone Checkpoint\nDark Zones now have DZ Checkpoints that are armed with automated turrets that guard the entrance of every Dark Zone, and they protect newcomers from\nRogue\nagents or enemies.\nInvaded Dark Zones\nBlack Tusk faction\nOnce players reach\nWorld Tier 1\n, Dark Zones will start becoming Invaded. The dangerous end-game faction\nBlack Tusk\nwill periodically move in one of the three Dark Zones and give you a challenge.\nLandmarks\nAs you explore the Dark Zone you will find\nLandmarks\n. These Landmarks can be special streets, stores, or just random abandoned buildings. These\nLandmarks\nare spots where you find strong elite opponents and also named enemies that guarantee good loot-drops for one and usually guard one of the Dark Zone Chests.\nLandmarks\nevolved over time. First, you just needed to clear them and later they got multiple waves. The\nLandmarks\nalso provide different challenges: Normal and Hard difficulty.\nWhen someone clears a\nLandmark\n, you can see it on the map and you also get a timer indicating how long ago it was cleared. This way you know that a player should be in the area.\nExtractions\nRogue Agent prepares the ambush\nThe only way to permanently keep contaminated loot and Dark Zone resources from the Dark Zone is to go through the extraction process. Each Dark Zone has three areas where you can call an extraction. Any player or group member can call the extraction but only one group can call an extraction in such an area. If an extraction is called, a clear visible flair is fired and the players and NPCs in the area will be alerted to the extraction. You will have a clear countdown of how long it takes for the helicopter to arrive.\nWhen the chopper has arrived, another timer will start and every member of the group can attach the contaminated loot to the rope that is dropped. Other players/groups may also attach their loot to the cable and fill up the remaining loot slots (there are 4 slots).\nOnce the timer is over, the helicopter takes the contaminated loot away. After that, you can pick up the decontaminated items from any Stash.\nThis extraction process is for loot only; the player will remain in the Dark Zone and can continue their search for loot.\nIt's important to note that, until the helicopter has left, other players can cut the rope and drop all the loot that is attached to it, allowing anyone to pick it up again and steal it. So it recommended to remain at the extraction and wait until the chopper has left - because only then is your loot safe.\nCutting the rope will turn you\nRogue\n, so expect players to protect their loot when this happens.\nSafe Rooms\nInside each Dark Zone, you can find a\nSafe Room\n. This Safe Room is personal to your group and can\u00b4t be entered by other players. This Safe Room has multiple exits that allow you to leave the place from a different exit. The Safe Room is easily recognizable thanks to the big circular marker on the wall. Once you enter the Safe Room, your ammo will be restocked as well.\nDark Zone Rank\nPlayer progression is split between Player Level and Dark Zone Rank. While the Player Level defines your progression as a character, your health pool, and what weapon and items you can equip, the Dark Zone Rank is more like a rank system.\nDark Zone XP is earned via Supply Drops, completing or hijacking extractions, revives, killing\nRogues\nor agents, or going\nManhunt\n. Basically some form of interaction with other players. Dying will cause you to lose some Dark Zone XP and potentially rank down. Currently, the maximum Dark Zone Rank is 50.\nThe Dark Zone Rank is also tied to the\nDark Zone Perks\nthat can be unlocked at the\nBase of Operations\n. One Perk becomes available every 5 DZ Ranks and if you drop down in rank, those perks may become deactivated again.\nDZ Supply Drops\nThis is a returning activity from\nTom Clancy's The Division\n. In regular intervals, you get a Dark Zone Supply Drop that will land somewhere in the Dark Zone. It will be guarded by strong NPCs and once you have cleared the area \u2013 you also need to claim the Supply Drop. When you claim it, you get the reward for the group or you can steal it for yourself and go\nRogue\nin the process. Those Supply Drops will be broadcasted over the map, so all players will know if the Supply Drop is being or was claimed.\nSupply Drops can happen in\nLandmarks\nthat are not active and the fights for these can feature multiple bosses or factions. This will not only raise the difficulty, but it will bring more variety into the game loop and makes the drops less predictable. Also, more bosses and factions mean a higher chance or contaminated loot, so fighting for these drops will be more lucrative.\nDark Zones Areas\nEvery Dark Zone has their own distinct environment, landmarks, and challenges. There are different challenges every time the player plays in the Dark Zone.\nDark Zone East\nLocated near the East Mall, Dark Zone East was a military-occupied area. An explosion at a containment storage containing\nDC-62\nled to massive casualties, forcing whatever was left of the\nJTF\nand the volunteers to evacuate the area and lead to the area being walled off. The wall off attempt was successful.\nDark Zone South\nLocated in Waterfront, Dark Zone South was the primary storage facility site for DC-62, as well as the back-up military base after DZ East was evacuated. A flood breached the vaults containing DC-62 and spilled it across the whole zone. The military and scientists within the zone were once again forced to evacuate and wall off the whole zone.\nDark Zone West\nLocated in Georgetown, the town willfully allowed the government to come in and fumigate the town with DC-62, long before the lethal effects were fully known. The area was walled off shortly after the first few deaths of the toxin happened, and is now a \"ghost town\".\nDark Zone Vendors\nDark Zone Vendor\nOutside of each Dark Zone's entrance is a\nDark Zone Vendor\nwho offers a rotating selection of items for sale, including at least one Dark Zone-exclusive item (barring\nRaid\n-exclusive\nExotic\nitems); however, they will only accept payment in\nDZ Resources\n.\nDZ Resources\ncan be obtained by deconstructing Contaminated items (requires extraction) or looting specific crates inside the Dark Zones (no extraction required).\nEach of the three Dark Zone Vendors have separate inventories. They will also buy items like other vendors, but only pay in\nE-Credits.\nGallery\nConcept art of a Non-Rogue Division agent and a Rogue Division agent exchanging gunfire between each other\nTwo Division agents entering a Dark Zone Checkpoint\nA Division agent extracting an item in the extraction zone by helicopter\nConcept art of a Division agent requesting for extraction whilst being protected by other two Division agents\nConcept art of Division agents standing around the entrance to Dark Zone South\nA Division agent in Dark Zone East getting ready to ambush a couple of enemies\nDivision agents in the Dark Zone in a deadlock situation with other Division agents\nTrivia\nPrior to\nTitle Update 8\n, Invaded Dark Zones were named Occupied Dark Zones, where gear normalization was deactivated. The update applied normalization to Invaded Dark Zones as well, meaning the only remaining difference in Invaded Dark Zones is the presence of Black Tusk.\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division 2"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Tom Clancy's The Division 2 | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Tom Clancy's The Division 2\nCompanies\nDevelopers\nMassive Entertainment\nRed Storm Entertainment\nUbisoft Reflections\nUbisoft Annecy\nPublisher\nUbisoft\nDirector\nJulian Gerighty\nMathias Karlson\nComposer\nOla Strandth\nDetails\nEngine\nSnowdrop\nPlatforms\nPlayStation 4\nPlayStation 5\nXbox One\nXbox Series X|S\nPC\nAmazon Luna\nRelease Date\nMarch 15, 2019\n\u201c\nJoin The Division, an elite group of civilian agents, and save a country on the brink of collapse as you explore an open, dynamic, and hostile world in\nWashington, D.C.\n- Description\n\u201d\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n(referred simply to as\nThe Division 2\n)\nis a tactical shooter action role-playing video game developed by\nMassive Entertainment\nas a sequel to\nTom Clancy's The Division\n.\nAn eight-player raid and three free story-driven DLCs were announced during the E3 2018 reveal. The game was supposed to enter end-of-life stage in 2021 when\nWarlords of New York\n/Year 2 ended with\nSeason 4: End of Watch\n. But thanks to player feedback, the dev team was rebuilt to keep supporting the game with new content, starting with\nSeason 9: Hidden Alliance\nin May 2022, with an\nupcoming DLC\ncoming out later in 2025.\nContents\n1\nOverview\n2\nPlot\n3\nFeatures\n4\nFactions\n4.1\nOther Factions\n4.2\nWarlords of New York\n4.3\nBattle for Brooklyn\n5\nDark Zones\n6\nGame Editions\n7\nUpdates/DLCs\n7.1\nExpansions\n7.2\nRaids\n7.3\nEpisodes\n7.4\nTitle Updates\n8\nSoundtrack\n9\nGallery\n9.1\nVideos\n10\nTrivia\n11\nReferences\nOverview\nThe events of\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\ntake place during the summer of\nWashington, D.C.\n, 7 months after the events of the\nDollar Flu\n, which took place\u00a0in the winter in\nNew York City\n. The virus has now spread to Washington, D.C. During the initial phase of the crisis, important personnel such as POTUS, Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff and other important politicians were being evacuated. The chaos of the virus began with attacks on the Pentagon, The National Mall and other landmarks. Riots followed the day after and the security forces were hit, forcing them to evacuate the capital. The dense heatwave added to more problems. The supply lines were cut off; after a few days survivors developed communities and many of them were armed, while the criminals have developed their own factions and raid these communities for supply and control. Factions like the\nTrue Sons\n, a group of paramilitary warlords bent on dominating their enemies and expanding their territory around Washington, D.C. These militants are led by a former\nJTF\nofficer\nAntwon Ridgeway\nwho, along with those that follow him, are a force to be reckoned with. Because of this,\nDirective 51\nhas been activated in Washington, D.C. and thus activates\nDivision agents\nwho launch a joint operation with the\nCivilian Militia\nin D.C. in order to recapture the capital.\nWashington, D.C. has been recreated to be as authentic as possible complete with well-known landmarks and buildings. Despite the possible controversy, Ubisoft has stated that the choice of location was not one of politics despite the fact the chosen location is the nation's capital.\nCombat will be similar to the original game, with a few new features which include new skills and new weapons. Players who help the citizens in D.C. may find some willing to take up arms and join the fight.\nPlot\nMain article:\nStory (The Division 2)\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several\nStrategic Homeland Division (SHD)\nagents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and communications, suddenly shuts down and they receive a Division distress call from Washington, D.C. The player\u2019s agent makes their way to the city where The Division and the remains of the local Joint Task Force have set up their Base of Operations in The White House. After defeating an attack on the White House shortly after arriving in the city, the agent is briefed on the general situation by\nManny Ortega\n, The Division controller for D.C. The agent learns that much of the city is under the control of three main enemy factions: the\nHyenas\n, a loosely organized group of several gangs, criminals, and anarchists who seek to take advantage of the chaos, the\nOutcasts\n, a fanatical group made up of the survivors of the Roosevelt Island quarantine zone, whom seek to exact revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection, and the\nTrue Sons\n, a highly organized and ruthless group of former Joint Task Force personnel, paramilitaries, and other traitors who seek to gain control over the entire capital. Ortega instructs the agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to help assist civilian settlements, fight the various enemy groups, and restore the SHD Network. Meanwhile, Ortega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of Air Force One and is being held by one of the city's factions. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to rescue Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure.\nThe agent continues to work to liberate city districts and eventually manages to find and rescue Ellis from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that a cure to not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exists but he can only access it with a special briefcase he had with him on Air Force One. However, the briefcase is in the possession of the True Sons who are holding it in their main base at the United States Capitol. With the Capitol too fortified to assault yet, the agent works to strengthen The Division's forces while continuing to weaken the other factions. Eventually, the agent is able to restore the SHD Network, connecting all Division agents nationwide, restoring the power and advantages of the Strategic Homeland Division to all agents across the United States. With the tide turning against them, the various factions retreat to their final strongholds - the\nDistrict Union Arena\n,\nRoosevelt Island\n, and the\nUnited States Capitol\n. Victories in each stronghold break the factions up and remove their leadership permanently, leaving the factions disorganized and in disarray.\nHowever, as the agent and The Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced private security contractor\nBlack Tusk\n, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis goes missing, leaving the agent to head out once again to repel the Black Tusk invasion. During this time, ECHOs reveal that the Black Tusk was responsible for the shutting down of the SHD Network and that they had been planning an invasion long before the agent had arrived, supplying arms to the Hyenas and what not. Similarly, the invasion causes mass chaos in D.C., with formerly liberated areas suddenly becoming hot zones and the settlements coming under threat once again. Despite this, the agent fights through each and every landmark once again, eventually somewhat stabilizing the situation in D.C., and is able to access the Broad-Spectrum Antivirals, apparently hidden in the Ellipse Complex near The White House. It is there that the agent discovers that Ellis had actually handed the Antivirals over to Black Tusk and that they are now being held at\nBlack Tusk's Tidal Basin Headquarters (in West Potomac Park)\n.\nFollowing this, the agent launches an ambitious invasion to finally remove the Black Tusk from D.C. by attacking Tidal Basin, as well as recovering the antivirals. The mission nearly ends in disaster, with desperate Black Tusk leadership attempting to launch a missile at The White House, but the agent eventually prevails, recovering the antivirals. Despite this, D.C. remains in total disarray, with four major hostile factions now jostling for power over the city in various different ways, while President and traitor Andrew Ellis remains missing.\nFeatures\nSpecializations\n- End game content that allows players to continue character and weapon progression with elite weapons and skill trees.

Joint Task Force.  A militia formed in the wake of the collapse of the Washington, D.C. JTF and the rise of the True Sons, Hyenas, and Outcasts, this militia seeks to maintain their settlements' independence and promote non-violent survival.\nContents\n1\nGameplay\n2\nEquipment\n3\nMilitia Types\n4\nQuotes\n5\nGallery\n6\nTrivia\n7\nReferences\nGameplay\nIf the player decides to help the militia with various tasks like gathering food and supplies, the militia can be called in a battle to assist the player in capturing control points around the city.\nAfter a battle, militia officers might ask the player for some medications, food, water, and components. The Civilian Militia also guard the exterior of the White House with the help of\nJTF\noperatives. Civilian Militia members are also seen at different parts of the city patrolling and scavenging for items they want to bring back to their settlement. They are however not a united faction, being dispersed into many groups in various locations.\nEquipment\nThe civilian militia have access to a vast array of scavenged weapons, but little equipment.\nTheir weapons vary widely, ranging from older shotguns and revolvers favored by Outcasts, to SMGs and pistols favored by the Hyenas, to high quality assault rifles and LMGs favored by the True Sons.\nThey have a limited access to secondary equipment, as most seem to favor WW2 era sling rigs, as well as hand torches and limited access to police equipment.\nMost have limited combat training, as they display better tactics and equipment than the Outcasts or Underground, but are outmatched by better equipped enemies such as the Hyenas, or better trained opponents such as the True Sons.\nMilitia Types\nMilitia Soldiers - Militia soldiers make up the bulk of the Militia force. Armed with various weaponry (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns) they are most commonly seen capturing control points, patrolling areas, scavenging for supplies, and delivering supplies to control points and their respected settlement.\nMilitia Officers - Officers usually lead their squad into battle when taking over a control point and are seen training new recruits in target practice. Armed with only a pistol, they are the only member of the Militia that can revive agents if they are downed. They are usually indicated by a green star marker.\nSettlement Guards - Sentry Guards are usually stationed at the entrances at their respected Settlements, protecting the entrances from hostiles, and are usually the ones to open up the entrance when they see a Division agent approaching.\nControl Point Guards - Guards armed with various assault rifles. They are stationed around the perimeter around their control point, engaging in hostiles that are patrolling through and defending their control points from hostiles that want to capture it. If the control point has a mounted weapon, CP Guards will be the first to man it.\nScouts - Militia members armed with various marksman rifles and high-range binoculars. They are seen on platforms that have high altitude, recon the area for special nodes that have much needed supplies and check the streets for hostile patrols. Usually they are alone, but sometimes have another member on the ground for backup.\nRushers - Militia members armed with an ax or a baseball bat, they are only seen rescuing hostages and/or taking over control points. They are rare to spawn.\nQuotes\n\u201c\nHere!  Take some of this shit!\n- A female Civilian Militia agent in a random attack quote against hostiles.\n\u201d\n\u201c\nCome on, people!

Most of the sidearms present in the game are Semi-Automatic.\nThree-Round Burst\nA sidearm that fires three bullets at a time; it does lower damage per bullet than a Semi-Auto but makes up for it in its number of bullets shot. The only Three-Round burst weapon is the\n93R\n.\nRevolvers\nRevolvers are fed their ammunition in (as the name implies) their revolving chamber and are reloaded via a revolver speedloader.

Included with the purchase is the new Level 30 Character Boost that is going live today with Episode 3. This is primarily designed to allow new and returning players to have an option to jump right into the narrative of the expansion, if they so desire.\nWe are also introducing a purchasable Level 30 Character Boost for 2000 Premium Credits, about 20\u20ac or your regional equivalent, that is mainly offered for players that wish to stay at base game but catch up right with the end game, as well as for players that want to get their alts to the Level 30 end-game faster.

Later, when the\nvirus\nwas discovered to have spread to\nWashington, D.C.\n, they formed a similar JTF under\u00a0full military control.\u00a0Understaffed and overworked with meager resources, they have been stretched thin to say the least. As ensuing unrest decimated their ranks, the JTF lost control, leaving the cities\u00a0to turn into lawless death-traps for all its citizens.\nUnable to effectively coordinate and manage the response, the JTF now puts their hope in the members of\nThe Division\nto lead the way. As such, all Division agents are strongly encouraged to assist the JTF, wherever possible, whether it's protecting supply drops or aiding civilians in need. Troops are scattered around\nNew York\nand are ready to assist Division agents or be assisted by them. Most men and women are tasked to protect the\nBase of Operations\nand any remaining secure locations like\nCamp Hudson\nwhile few of them are in charge of gathering information and reconnaissance and sending this data to SHD. The JTF also man various checkpoints throughout the city and sends out patrols whenever possible in order to increase stability and security all around New York City.\nBy the time of the events of\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n, the JTF units stationed in\nWashington, D.C.\nhave all but collapsed. A large-scale mutiny led by\nAntwon Ridgeway\nsaw the creation of a hostile splinter faction known as the\nTrue Sons\n. The majority of JTF volunteers who remained loyal to the U.S. government were evacuated elsewhere under Presidential orders, with only a skeleton crew staying behind to keep\nThe White House\noperational, either as guards around the perimeter or as support and technical crews in\u00a0the interior. Most of their original functions have been taken over by the\nCivilian Militia\nof the\nD.C. Settlements\n, a National Guard Signalist,\nManny Ortega\nleads what remains of the JTF and coordinates with The Division to help the agents out in the ongoing quest to restore government control of the city.\nThe JTF work with\nThe Division\nand the allied Civilian Militia to combat the growing threat of the\nTrue Sons\n, the\nHyenas\n, and the\nOutcasts\n. After those factions are successfully dismantled, Washington is suddenly attacked by an invading force of\u00a0private military contractors and mercenaries, the\nBlack Tusk\n.\nKnown JTF Members\nKnown JTF Officers\nName\nDescription\nLocation\nMartin Hazen\nGear Vendor in\nPlymouth Rock\n139th Plymouth St\nBrooklyn\nJB Keller\nWeapons Vendor in\nKerman Station\nWest 34th St and Hudson Blvd East\nHudson Yards\nBryce Thompson\nGear Vendor in\nThe Cavern\nWest of West 34th St and 7th Ave\nGarment District\nSimon Kapornick\nWeapons Vendor in\nThe Meat Locker\nEast of West 24th St and 7th Ave\nTenderloin\nKelly Garcia\nGear Vendor in\nDante's Run\nEast of West 42nd and 10th Ave\nHell's Kitchen\nWinston Jefferson\nGear Vendor in\nAutumn's Hope\nEast of West 49th St and Broadway Ave\nTimes Square\nSammy O'Hara\nWeapons Vendor in\nWolves Den\nSoutheast of West 52nd St and 9th Ave\nClinton\nAnthony Zappa\nGear Vendor in\nMadison's Stand\nEast 29th St and Madison Ave\nFlatiron District\nSuzie Broughn\nWeapons Vendor in\nThe Last Call\nWest of East 20th st and 1st Ave\nGramercy\nSam Johnson\nGear Vendor in\nThe Ward\nSouth of East 23rd St and Avenue C\nGramercy\nPaul Aguilar\nGear Vendor in\nSouthpaw\nNorthwest of East 29th St and 1st Ave\nKips Bay\nAlbert Gutnick\nWeapons Vendor in\nGrindhouse\nWest of East 38th St and 3rd Ave\nMurray Hill\nLissa Montelli\nGear Vendor in\nThe Firewall\nEast 43rd St and 2nd Ave\nTurtle Bay\nTeresa Lopez\nWeapons Vendor in\nThe Crypt\nEast of East 52nd St and Madison Ave\nMidtown East\nEvents prior to Tom Clancy's The Division\nInitially,\nNew York City\nserved as the ground zero for the\nDollar Flu\noutbreak. Not understanding how devastating the virus was initially, JTF leadership badly butchered the governmental response to the outbreak. The situation eventually escalated out of control, and for the first time in American history, one of their cities was placed under lockdown. To make matters worse,\nprisoners at Rikers Island\nwere able to escape and make it onto the mainland, further amplifying the violence already spreading through the city. From then on, chaos spread further as JTF forces, already stretched thin, were unable to deal with the newly escaped prisoners and the virus.\nPresident Waller\n, under the counseling of his cabinet, activated the first wave of Division agents to provide reinforcements to the struggling JTF forces.\nNow reinforced by Division agents, the JTF were able to restore some semblance of control over the city, segregating infected individuals into areas that would eventually be known as\nDark Zones\n. In addition, the JTF leadership was able to broker a deal with the\nLast Man Battalion\n, who would assist them in securing New York. This alliance would eventually collapse in a matter of weeks as both sides disagreed with each other's methods.\nFurther unrest and a lack of a solution to the virus would undo all the progress that JTF forces had desperately tried to maintain. Eventually, a lack of morale and a lack of manpower proved fatal to JTF forces as their leadership ordered that they abandon the Dark Zones to its fate. First Wave Division agents who were caught off-guard by the JTF's sudden withdrawal begun going\nrogue\n, believing that their government had abandoned them. In their haste to abandon the Dark Zones, the JTF left behind many valuable assets, such as weapons and equipment. Now scattered and in disarray, the remaining JTF forces abandoned much of the city and pulled back the majority of their forces into safe areas.\nIn\nWashington, D.C.\n, another outbreak occurred and a similar JTF was formed under military control. However, the situation proved to be even worse than the one in New York, leading to the declaration of martial law as the JTF struggled to place infected civilians into designated quarantine zones. Eventually, things would reach a boiling point as civilians begun rioting. To make matters worse,\nAntwon Ridgeway\n, a colonel in the JTF, begun executing and starving infected citizens, believing that they were as good as dead. The JTF leadership soon caught wind of his actions and jailed him; however, staunch loyalists from his unit broke him out and mutinied against the JTF. The JTF in Washington, D.C., deciding that the capital was a lost cause, retreated to other areas of the country while leaving a skeleton crew to defend and maintain The White House. For all intents and purposes, the JTF had collapsed, leaving the remaining civilian population without an organized force for protection and security.\nEvents of Tom Clancy's The Division\nOutgunned and outnumbered, the JTF were unable to maintain order in the city. Eventually, the Second Wave of\nDivision\nagents was activated and had begun to restore order in\nBrooklyn\n, wiping out Rioters and regaining control of the island. Meanwhile, the sole commander of the New York JTF forces,\nRoy Benitez\n, had departed the\nBase of Operations\nto try and secure the\nLincoln Tunnel Checkpoint\n, as\nRioters\nwere trying to blow up the floodgate in order to escape Manhattan. If they succeeded, the Lincoln Tunnel would be flooded and the JTF would lose a major supply line.\nAs Division agents were departing Brooklyn for Manhattan, an\nLMB\nSAM (surface-to-air missile) wiped out a majority of Second Wave Division agents, as well as their leader,\nLouis Chang\n. With only two agents barely surviving the horrific attack, the JTF deployed a rescue team to fly them to\nCamp Hudson\n, Manhattan for medical treatment.\nBeginning operations there, the Division agents soon rescued the JTF forces at the struggling Base of Operations against Rioters and took de facto command of the JTF forces in the absence of Captain Benitez. Within days, The Division quickly mobilized and rescued\nJessica Kandel\n,\nCaptain Benitez\nand\nPaul Rhodes\n. Their rescue and subsequent arrival to the Base of Operations proved to be a major boost in morale as they begun coordinating JTF forces to retake the city.\nIn a matter of weeks, both The Division and JTF retook much of the city block-by-block and eliminated the leadership of each faction, crippling them and effectively turning the tide of the JTF's previously failing fortunes.\nFaye Lau\neven mentions that civilians felt much safer to come out due to the consistent JTF patrols and their presence assuring them of their safety.\nEventually, after crippling major LMB operations, they finally began preparing an assault against their headquarters at the\nU.N. Building\n. The JTF played a secondary yet vital role in preventing the LMB reinforcements from attacking the infiltrating Division agents, eventually winning the battle after a lengthy fight.\nAs each of the factions begun destabilizing, the JTF took advantage of the opportunity to redeploy into previously abandoned districts, including investigating missing persons reports that were put on the back- burner due to the JTF's previously underwhelming strength.\nHowever, the JTF intelligence received reports of LMB forces gathering in one of their underground bases and deployed several squads to investigate the reports, but not before losing contact with them and deploying Division agents in their stead. After their success, however, the remaining factions united in a last-ditch attempt to wipe out the JTF and Division agents, only to fail miserably and eventually disband.\nEvents of Tom Clancy's The Division 2\nWashington, D.C.\nSometime between spring and early summer, the bulk of the\nWashington, D.C.\nJTF force evacuated the city. The skeleton crew left behind in D.C. were unable to carry out further operations beyond guarding and maintaining\nThe White House\ndue to a lack of manpower, and as a result, the responsibility of defending the city was left to the\nCivilian Militia\n. Although the JTF assisted the civilian settlements in any way possible, the extent of their help was limited. Eventually, a covert attack was launched by the\nBlack Tusk\nonto the\nSHD Network\n, leaving Division operations crippled nationwide. In response, Division agents began converging on the nation's capital, hoping to find out what happened to the SHD Network and restore it.\nOne notable agent arrived in D.C. after the civilian settlement where they were stationed at was attacked by Black Tusk forces just as the network went down. As they arrived,\nHyena\nforces launched an attack on\nThe White House\n. The agent then assisted the outnumbered JTF forces in repelling them successfully. Linking up with the Division coordinator,\nManny Ortega\n, \"The Sheriff\" began visiting the different settlements, rallying the Civilian Militia to assist the beaten JTF forces. Having rescued\nEleanor Sawyer\n, Theatre leader\nOdessa Sawyer's\ndaughter, \"The Sheriff\" earned the\nTheater Settlement\n's goodwill, agreeing to help them in their fight against the other factions. Unfortunately, days later, the White House received a mayday request from the\nCastle Settlement\n, and Division agent\nKelso\nwas sent to assess the situation. Contact with her was soon lost after she arrived, where \"The Sheriff\" was then sent to find out what happened. Upon arrival, it is soon found out that the entire Castle Settlement was wiped out, hit by a chemical attack by\nTrue Son\nforces. Angered, Agent Kelso ordered \"The Sheriff\" to hunt down those responsible. In addition, JTF forces discovered that the Hyenas were holding\nPresident Ellis\nhostage, and with the efforts of \"The Sheriff\", they were able to evacuate him back to The White House.\nEventually, \"The Sheriff\" began hunting down each faction's different leaders, storming the\nUnion District Arena\nto hunt down much of the\nHyena Council\nand battling through the\nRoosevelt Island\nstronghold of the\nOutcasts\nonly to just barely fail to capture their leader,\nEmeline Shaw\n. \"The Sheriff's\" hard work had paid off, morale had returned within members of the JTF and their allies, gaining enough manpower and support to launch a joint operation with Division agents and the Civilian Militia against the True Sons stronghold in the\nU.S. Capitol Building\nto recover the\nanti-virals\n. With\nGeneral Ridgeway\nkilled, much of the remaining True Sons surrendered or fled in scattered groups, no longer able to organize effectively as they once could previously.\nWith victory guaranteed, JTF and other allied forces began celebrating yet, concurrently and unbeknownst to them,\nBlack Tusk\nforces began storming the nation's capitol, effectively reversing much of the JTF and Division's progress in the previous weeks. Caught off-guard, the JTF and Civilian Militia occupying the different strongholds were wiped out, with the settlements put under lockdown by the Black Tusk. In addition,\nPresident Ellis\nhad disappeared during the chaos along with the\nanti-virals\n, with the JTF continuing to operate under the assumption that he had been kidnapped. However, in reality, he was working with the Black Tusk all along, having coordinated with BTSU leader\nBardon Schaeffer\nto take over the capital.\nThe JTF did not collapse as BTSU higher-ups had hoped and still continued their stubborn resistance and attempts to regain control of the anti-virals. The JTF continued to operate under the auspices of Division command, where\nManny Ortega\nbegan rapidly coordinating whatever assets he could spare to assist two of the remaining field agents left standing: Agent Kelso and \"The Sheriff\". Placing much of their faith in \"The Sheriff\", the JTF knew that they would not let them down and continued working around the clock, providing assistance when needed.\nTheir faith eventually paid off as \"The Sheriff\" rapidly crippled BTSU operations, inflicting such casualties that BTSU higher-ups were completely caught off-guard, proving unable to replenish their forces in time. Re-energized by \"The Sheriff's\" efforts, the JTF launched an all-out assault against the BTSU stronghold at\nTidal Basin\n, using support teams and helicopters to secure the anti-virals and ward off and Black Tusk reinforcements. As they observed \"The Sheriff\" approaching the landing craft, a JTF helicopter was sent to assist them but was shot down just as it arrived, crashing into the rotors. Out of options and getting desperate, BTSU operator \"\nWyvern\n\" decided to launch a missile attack on the White House, directly defying the explicit orders of BTSU leader Bardon Schaeffer. However, \"The Sheriff\" was able to eliminate \"Wyvern\" and halt the missile strike in the nick of time and recover the stolen anti-virals.\nWhile much of the Black Tusk elite members were eliminated, the BTSU still had a technological edge over the JTF, however, with much of their manpower depleted, the JTF and the allied forces at least had a fighting chance against them. The vast majority of the BTSU were recalled from the capital, deciding to re-focus much of their remaining forces elsewhere, but occasionally sent an invasion force to try and recapture the Tidal Basin stronghold.\nDespite the major defeat of BTSU forces, the JTF received an unexpected alert from The Pentagon, where they found out Black Tusk forces were planning to extract equipment that could potentially mass-produce the anti-virals. Unwilling to allow such vital equipment to fall in enemy hands, the JTF sent \"The Sheriff\" to the site, who promptly began wiping out Black Tusk forces at the site, recovering the equipment in the process.\nSome weeks after their victory,\nAaron Keener\nresurfaced, this time at\nConey Island\nand was mysteriously in an apparent alliance with Black Tusk forces. This discovery alarmed Division higher ups and \"The Sheriff\" was sent to eliminate Keener and rescue virologist\nVitaly Tchernenko\n, who had gone missing since Keener kidnapped him from the\nRussian Consulate\n. As \"The Sheriff\" ravaged much of the Black Tusk forces, they successfully extracted the Russian virologist, having dealt with both Black Tusk field commander\nDolores Jones\nand partially aided with the unexpected arrival of the\nCleaners\n, operating under the direction of Keener's rogue agent cell. Yet Keener had slipped out of their grasps once more, leaving Division agents frustrated at their failure.\nAnother few weeks passed by when JTF and Division command received a distress call from their branches in\nNew York City\n, deploying \"The Sheriff\" and Agent Kelso to assist them.\nWarlords of New York\nNew York City\nWith much of the violence winding down and a sense of stability returning to the city, the JTF lowered their guard, sending less patrols to patrol the streets. This would prove to be a fatal mistake when the other factions, like the\nRikers\n, exploited their vulnerability.\nHeather Lau\n, acting Division commander\nFaye Lau\n's sister, was amongst those killed during one of such attacks by\nRikers\n. In addition,\nAaron Keener\n, having escaped from the\nDivision's\nclutches, recruited different\nRogue Agents\nwho would begin manipulating the crippled factions by providing them with equipment to effectively combat the JTF forces.\nThese resurgent attacks by the once-crippled factions proved to have a devastating effect on the morale in the JTF. Having lost faith in the JTF's ability to protect them, many civilians and former personnel, including\nPaul Rhodes\n, eventually began leaving to form their own settlements and rejected assistance from the Division, believing that they only served to ensure even more chaos. Keener eventually launched a coordinated attack against the JTF and Division at their base of operations at\nCity Hall\n, and they soon lost their foothold in\nLower Manhattan\nto both\nRikers\nand the\nCleaners\n, both now led by Rogue Agents.\nPresumably a few months before the events of Warlords of New York, both the JTF and Division seemed to be in a much stronger spot than their Washington counterparts, achieving a somewhat stable peace in New York. However, when\nAaron Keener\nre-entered the city, things began to spiral downhill. With his recruitment of four fellow Rogue Agents, the city's fragile peace began to relapse as old threats resurged. The Cleaners, now rallied and organized under\nVivian Conley\n, begun sniffing out JTF operations that involved treating the sick, as well as being generally hostile to any JTF patrols. The Rikers also began making a rebound under\nJames Dragov\n, who stockpiled weapons and supplies for his growing 'family.' Rogue Agent\nJavier Kajika\nespecially had bloodlust for the JTF, working in conjunction with the Cleaners and Keener to actively hunt down JTF officials and patrols who he believed were responsible for leaving him for dead. As the JTF began to collapse in Lower Manhattan, Keener finally delivered the final blow with his new bioweapon: the\nEclipse\nvirus. Keener, in par with his coalition of rogue agents, attacked the JTF and Division Base of Operations at\nCity Hall\n, effectively destroying the installation. However, Keener did not stop there. Keener also showcased the Eclipse virus at the JTF base at\nCastle Clinton\n, leaving only one survivor, Dan Abbat. The JTF shelter in the\nTwo Bridges\narea was also torched by the Cleaners, most likely under the belief that the JTF were treating the sick. As of now, the JTF presence in Lower Manhattan has been severely diminished with the arrival of the rogue agents, with surviving personnel either joining the\nPeacekeepers\nor are operating at installations in other parts of the city.\nGameplay\nThe Division/Midtown Manhattan, New York City\nJTF members fill the role with allies. They can be seen stationed at checkpoints, guarding certain areas, patrolling the streets, and will be used in certain\nMissions\nand\nEncounters\n. However, it is unwise for players to rely on any JTF that assists them in combat even against low level\nRioters\n. High level enemies, or even large enough numbers of enemies, can chew through squads of JTF if not dealt with. They infrequently engage targets, but their attacks are usually inaccurate and deal very little damage. However, they can kill low level Rioters if there are 2-3 of them.\nThey also lack unit\narchetypes\nsuch as engineer, heavy weapons, and sniper thus reducing the JTF's ability to counter most enemy types in-game.\nThey should not be underestimated, however. Despite their low damage output, they are fairly durable and can suppress and distract enemies, which can prove invaluable to the player even in most dire circumstances.\nAbandoned JTF vehicles ranging from police cars to armored transports can be spotted throughout the city. More often than not, the corpses of dead JTF personnel are a very common sight. Whether it be death from entanglements with the\nRioters\n, brutally murdered by\nRikers\n, or executed by\nLast Man Battalion\nfiring squads.\nAfter finishing a quest or encounter, the location will permanently become a JTF checkpoint, and 2-4 troopers will occupy the area and occasionally engage passing enemies.\nLower Manhattan, New York/Warlords of New York\nThe JTF, as an independent organization, does not play a significant role in\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n's Warlords of New York. Units in\nLower Manhattan\nhave either collapsed with the loss of\nCity Hall\nor have joined the\nPeacekeepers\n, a civilian and JTF militia. JTF members can be found patrolling the streets of Lower Manhattan in par with civilians, and can also be seen at their settlement,\nHaven\n. Although it is hinted the JTF has other installations in other parts of the city, the JTF is no longer properly operating in Lower Manhattan. However, the JTF do play larger roles in a couple of missions:\nJavier Kajika Manhunt\n:\nQuarantined Skyscraper\n- While investigating a Peacekeeper distress beacon, the agent discovers the bodies of a few dead JTF members along with a few burnt-out police cars.\nJavier Kajika Manhunt\n:\nHugh Carey Tunnel\n- The agent is sent to investigate a missing JTF patrol last seen investigating tremors at the\nHugh Carey Tunnel\n. It is soon revealed through an\nECHO\nthat three of the four JTF soldiers in the patrol were burned alive by the\nCleaners\n, with the only surviving member of the patrol, John Bronson, being captured and taken to\nPathway Park\nunder Kajika's orders. Bronson is soon executed by Kajika at the beginning of his final mission.\nSide Mission:\nCastle Clinton\n- The agent is asked to investigate\nbillowing red smoke\nat the JTF base in Castle Clinton. Upon arrival, it is revealed that the base has been overrun with Cleaners. After taking out the Cleaners guarding the entrance of the base, the player proceeds inside the base, where they then assist Dan Abbat, a surviving JTF soldier from the base. After Dan reveals the smoke came from a\nCERA\nsupply crate in the courtyard, the agent investigates further, taking out more Cleaners. After the area is secured,\nISAC\nis able to gather enough data from the base's security systems to put together an\nECHO\nas to how the smoke materialized in the base. In the ECHO, it is soon revealed that the JTF soldiers stationed in the base unknowingly opened up the crate, believing it was a CERA supply cache, only to then be exposed to the horrific effects of\nKeener's\nbioweapon. After the majority of JTF soldiers are killed by the bioweapon, the Cleaners are then sent in to clean up any survivors and secure the area.\nVivian Conley Manhunt\n:\nJTF Shelter\n- The agent is sent in response to an attack on a JTF shelter in the\nTwo Bridges\ndistrict. It is soon revealed that all of the JTF and civilians in the shelter have been killed at the hands of Vivian Conley and her Cleaners, presumably for treating the sick.\nWashington, D.C.\nIn\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n, the JTF units stationed in\nWashington, D.C.\nhave all but collapsed, with personnel either evacuating or joining the\nTrue Sons\n. Now, JTF personnel just act as NPC's guarding and working at\nThe White House\n. They are not seen anywhere else in the open world, as their patrol and assist duties and been replaced by\nCivilian Militia\n. The JTF members that staff the White House appear to be a combination of national guardsmen, as well as members of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. The bodies of JTF members can also be found throughout the city, like outside the White House's eastern checkpoint and at\nThe Cinderblock\nControl Point, with many others being scattered throughout miscellaneous parts of the city.\nJTF personnel use DCPD police cars, armored Humvees, army transportation trucks, UH-60 Black Hawks and UH-72 Lakota helicopters as transportation.\nThough during some missions, the JTF does play a larger role than usual:\nThe most prevalent role the JTF play in\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nis the pickup and extraction of agents and objects (\nanti-virals\n,\nFusion Bioreactor\n) via helicopter in main missions, strongholds and\nDark Zone\nextractions. JTF pilots usually fly UH-72 U.S. Army Lakota helicopters.\nCamp White Oak\n: JTF forces attempt to secure a helipad to ensure that\nPresident Ellis\ndoes not avoid Division capture; at the end, they fail, and their attacking forces are wiped out by the\nBlack Tusk\n.\nIn the\ninvaded version of the mission\n, the agent is sent back to Camp White Oak after a JTF forensics team is attacked by a Black Tusk contingent force (as well as candidates for\nBardon Schaeffer's\nBlack Tusk unit) attempting to destroy valuable intel. As the agent progresses through the mission, both JTF and Black Tusk comms indicate an increasingly hectic situation for the JTF, with the Black Tusk ultimately overrunning the JTF force. In the end, the agent arrives too late to save any members of the JTF.\nKenley College\n: A JTF convoy carrying important equipment was attacked and destroyed by Outcasts.\nJack Arnold\n, a JTF engineer with the supply convoy heading to D.C., was taken as prisoner by the\nOutcasts\nto help them set up their IEDs after they ambush the convoy and overwhelm JTF forces. Arnold is later rescued and protected by Division agents.\nTidal Basin\n: A JTF support team lead by an unnamed JTF engineer, assisted by other JTF soldiers and defended by Division agents, helps open up the inner gate of the stronghold, allowing agents to head in and secure the\nBroad-Spectrum Antiviral\nsamples from the Black Tusk. JTF forces also move in to secure the antivirals once the Black Tusk forces are neutralized by Division agents. The brave JTF pilot of Thunderbird One also played a heroic role in securing the remaining antivirals, with the pilot purposefully crashing into the rotors of the Black Tusk's hovercraft. This crippled the boat's motor capabilities, prompting\nMilla \"Wyvern\" Radek\nto stand her ground and fight The Division instead of evacuating by foot.\nConey Island\n: JTF drone operator\nCindy McAllister\nwas deployed to assist the agent in securing\nVitaly Tchernenko\nby updating the agent on the current situation of the park. Later on in the mission, after\nISAC\nhacks into a Black Tusk mortar system, McAllister uses the Black Tusk mortars to help clear a path for the agent. McAllister also helped the agent in intercepting and eliminating Dolores Jones while dealing with Cleaners and Black Tusk.\nMexican Embassy\n(\nClassified Assignment\n): The JTF was doing a supply run at the Mexican Embassy when the Outcasts shot down their Chinook helicopter. The agent must secure the embassy, reach the downed helo, and rescue JTF pilot\nJohn Yazzie\n.\nJTF Types\nNew York City\nIn N.Y.C., one could tell if someone is part of the JTF by looking out for their green vests and headwear.\nNYPD Police Officer - Armed with\nMP5\nsub machine guns,\nM870\nshotguns and\nPF45\nhandguns.

Always sporting Army ACUs.\nJTF Pilot - JTF pilots are only seen on certain missions and in Dark Zone extractions. JTF pilots have been seen to fly dark green UH-72 Lakota helicopters brandishing the \"U.S. Army\" logo, as well as news helicopters. JTF pilots sport a dark green pilot helmet with a white stripe running down the middle and supposedly wear army ACUs with a signature JTF green vest.\nHAZMAT JTF - HAZMAT JTF can be found in contaminated zones, Dark Zones and decontamination zones, like the decontamination checkpoint at the entrance of\nCamp Hudson\nand in the isolation ward of the Base of Operations. The HAZMAT JTF do not play a significant part in the game whatsoever, usually just working in the background of safe zones. Dead HAZMAT JTF are a common sight in the Dark Zone and contaminated zones, usually slumped over ambulances or lying dead in the middle of infected zones. HAZMAT JTF can be easily identified with their full-yellow HAZMAT suits and a signature green JTF vest topping the suit off.\nWashington, D.C.\nIn D.C., one can tell if someone is a JTF member by looking at the back of their T-shirts, which will have \"JTF\" printed on them.\nSentry Guards - Armed with various rifles and assault rifles, these personnel are stationed at most entrances, checkpoints and guard towers around the White House. Their appearances vary, wearing a mix of white T-shirts with the DCPD and JTF logo, olive green T-shirts with the JTF logo, camouflage green cargo pants or dark blue cargo pants (both with holsters).\nMaintenance/Support Crew - These personnel make up the bulk of the D.C. JTF Force, working and operating in the interior of The White House. Their tasks consist of maintaining the SHD servers in the basement, routinely radioing\nSettlements\nto check on their situations, gathering intel on the current state of the city and taking stock on supplies. Maintenance personnel also perform other minor chores in The White House, such as cleaning or maintaining equipment. Maintenance and support crews wear a mix of white T-shirts with the DCPD and JTF logo, olive green T-shirts with the JTF logo, camouflage green cargo pants or dark blue cargo pants (both with holsters).\nJTF Pilot - JTF pilots in Washington play larger roles than in the first game, making appearances in a number of missions, strongholds and in\nDark Zone\nextractions. JTF pilots fly dark green UH-72 Lakota helicopters with the same \"U.S. Army\" logo, with Washington pilots still sporting the same dark green pilot helmet.\nHAZMAT JTF - Dead HAZMAT JTF can be found in certain missions, such as the\nTrue Sons National Bond Armory\nand in the\nDARPA Labs\nin the\nPentagon\n. These dead HAZMAT JTF sport a near-identical design to their New York counterparts, with the same yellow HAZMAT suit and a green JTF vest.\nQuotes\nHoly Crap how'd you do that?!\n- After a battle has finished\nHate this PMC bullshit!\n- JTF engaging with LMB forces\nLMB?

They all share the same green helmets and vests, but police wear blue uniforms underneath, while national guardsmen wear army uniforms.\nSome members of the JTF in uniform may be civilians recruited after the outbreak, however. This is evidenced by the fact that some JTF Officers, such as Anthony Zappa and JB Keller, wear uniforms but claim to have had professions other than police or guardsmen. In\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n, several ECHOs revealed JTF members with backgrounds including security guards for federal museums and monuments.\nAccording to the\nECHOs\n, the JTF also includes Marine Corps personnel in their ranks. As National Guardsmen are technically U.S. Army personnel, it is likely that much of the National Guard was federalized to form the JTF.\nIf the player purchases the JTF Outfit Bundle from the Premium Vendor in the first game, they will get the National Guardsman design (albeit the helmet and vest part of the jacket is a lighter shade of green, and the camouflage pattern on the fatigues is slightly different). The helmet returns in\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n, although only as a prop rather than as a cosmetic item. Another JTF outfit appears in the apparel store of\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n, but it does not match any previously seen JTF uniforms, possibly using the U.S. Woodland pattern (1981-2005) or an odd variation of the Operational Camouflage Pattern (standard issue U.S. Army camouflage post-2019) rather than the Universal Camouflage Pattern (Army digital from 2005-2019). Another piece of store apparel, the Field Operative pants, uses the U.S. Navy \"blueberry\" digital patter.\nIf an agent discharges their firearm near a JTF patrol or soldier, they will flinch, look at the player, and call them out on it. Similarly, they will call out an agent if they're caught aiming their weapon at them.\nIn\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n, JTF members at the White House may sometimes sling their weapons and salute the agent.\nIn\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nand\nWarlords of New York,\nthe JTF have multiple designs. In ECHOs found throughout Washington, D.C., JTF soldiers are seen wearing the same uniform as the National Guard JTF during\nTom Clancy's The Division\n, but troops at the White House simply wear T-shirts and police or army pants\n.\nIn the cutscene that plays when the agent plays back the surveillance footage from City Hall in New York, both the National Guard and police variants from\nTom Clancy's The Division\nare seen guarding the entrance to the BOO, but all of the corpses in the Town Hall are the casual T-shirt variants.\nCertain JTF pilots in\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n(i.e., Dark Zone extraction pilots) seem to retain their uniforms from the previous game, while others use entirely new uniforms (such as the\nWarlords of New York\npilot) or the casual attire of the White House JTF (such as the main Helipad pilot).\nAt Castle Clinton, a JTF survivor named Dan Abbat can be seen wearing the JTF casual attire (police version) with a camouflage vest. At the beginning of Javier Kajika's final mission, Kajika is seen executing the final member of a JTF patrol,\nJohn Bronson\n. Upon further inspection of Bronson's body, he is wearing UCP Army Combat Uniform pants and a matching cap, as well as UCP-Delta (an extremely limited issue, short-lived pattern) body armor over a green JTF vest (similar to Peacekeeper control point officers). In other ECHOs seen throughout Lower Manhattan, like the Hugh Carey Tunnel ECHO, the Castle Clinton ECHO, and the Pathway ECHO, JTF soldiers are seen wearing several different types of body armor over their casual attire.\nSome Peacekeepers can be seen with National Guard pants, although the camouflage color is much more orange or brown rather than the normal greens and greys.\nIn\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n, although police armor and helmets appear in The White House, JTF NPCs were not seen wearing any body armor until\nWarlords of New York\nwas released.\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n(\nWarlords of New York\nExpansion)"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Allen \"Hyena\" Green | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "\u201c\nI won't let you take them.\n- Allen \"Hyena\" Green\n\u201d\nAllen \"Hyena\" Green\nBiographical Information\nFull Name\nAllen Green\nAge\nUnknown\nStatus\nDeceased\nOccupation\nBlack Tusk Operative\nAffliliations\nFactions\nBlack Tusk\nPeople\nNatalya Sokolova\nMikael \"Rhino\" Smith\n(\nDeceased\n)\nTiana \"Firefly\" Lopez\n(\nDeceased\n)\nFelicity \"Panther\" Lee\n(\nDeceased\n)\nAllen \"Hyena\" Green\nwas a\nBlack Tusk\nOperative tasked with escorting and protecting D.C.

Once a bustling artery of commerce and culture, the river now flows through a city ravaged by the\nGreen Poison\n- a weaponized smallpox variant that decimated the population and fractured society. It's murky waters and desolate banks reflect the chaos of a world where order has crumbled, yet it remains a strategic and symbolic lifeline for those fighting to rebuild.\nThe River\u2019s Role in the Crisis\nWhen the\nGreen Poison\nswept through\nManhattan\n, the Hudson River became a natural barrier and a contested frontier. As panic gripped the city, bridges like the George Washington and\nLincoln Tunnel\nwere choked with fleeing citizens, only to become deathtraps as the virus spread. The river\u2019s western banks, including parts of New Jersey and Hoboken, were initially seen as safer havens, but the virus\u2019s relentless spread soon rendered such hopes futile. The federal government, in a desperate bid to contain the\noutbreak\n, established quarantine zones, with the Hudson serving as a dividing line between Manhattan\u2019s dark heart and the mainland.\nThe river\u2019s ports and docks, once humming with ferries and trade, fell silent. Abandoned boats and barges now drift aimlessly or lie wrecked along the shores, their hulls claimed by factions like the\nRikers\n- escaped convicts from\nRikers Island\nwho turned the river\u2019s chaos to their advantage. These outlaws used the Hudson to smuggle supplies, weapons, and even infected materials, exploiting the lack of centralized authority. The river\u2019s currents carried not just water but rumors of betrayal, as survivors whispered of\nRogue Agents\nand shadowy groups operating from it's foggy banks.\nStrategic Importance\nFor the Strategic Homeland Division (\nSHD\n), the Hudson River is both an obstacle and an opportunity. Agents deployed to\nManhattan\nrely on the river for supply drops and extractions, with temporary SHD outposts established at key points like the\nHudson Yards\nor\nPier 26\n. However, these sites are vulnerable to ambushes by hostile factions, including the\nCleaners\n, who see the river as a dumping ground for their incineration campaigns, or the\nLast Man Battalion\n, who fortify it's crossings to control movement.\nThe river\u2019s bridges and tunnels, though heavily damaged, are critical chokepoints. Securing them means controlling the flow of resources and information between Manhattan and the outside world. Division agents often undertake high-risk missions to clear these routes, facing snipers perched on rusting girders or IEDs hidden in submerged wrecks. The Hudson\u2019s tides also conceal dangers - flooded tunnels and collapsed piers make navigation treacherous, and rumors persist of experimental bioweapons dumped into it's depths by the virus\u2019s creators.\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division\nTom Clancy's The Division Resurgence"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: D.C. Dark Zones | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "For the Dark Zone in Tom Clancy's The Division, see\nN.Y.C. Dark Zone\n.\n\u201c\nThe Dark Zone is a place for wolves and not sheep.\n- Description\n\u201d\nThe\nDecontamination Zones of the District of Columbia\n, colloquially known as the\nDark Zones of D.C.\n, are\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n's\nversion of the open Player Versus Player (PVP) zones with some Player Versus Environment (PVE) elements tied-in.\nThe Dark Zone is an untamed area of the map where any agents can go off the grid to do terrible things. The Dark Zone is also the most dangerous area in the game, where fear, betrayal, and tensions are high, as any other agent can turn against you and steal your hard-earned loot.\nThe Dark Zone is per design an area that provides many challenges. The NPCs you meet are brutal \u2013 but the biggest challenge has always been the other players. While the DZ used to have a lot of features to make the DZ more PVE player-friendly, with\nTitle Update 8\nmany of these changes were reversed and the Dark Zone became more focused on PVP.\nContents\n1\nDark Zone Story\n2\nGameplay\n2.1\nNormalization\n2.2\nGoing Rogue\n2.3\nDark Zone Checkpoints\n2.4\nInvaded Dark Zones\n2.5\nLandmarks\n2.6\nExtractions\n2.7\nSafe Rooms\n3\nDark Zone Rank\n4\nDZ Supply Drops\n5\nDark Zones Areas\n5.1\nDark Zone East\n5.2\nDark Zone South\n5.3\nDark Zone West\n6\nDark Zone Vendors\n7\nGallery\n8\nTrivia\n9\nAppearances\nDark Zone Story\nConsequences of DC-62\nIn the early days of the\noutbreak\n, the government attempted to eradicate the\nvirus\n. When these attempts failed, they walled off the most contaminated areas to try to quarantine them. In these newly established Dark Zones, an experimental chemical was deployed to try to help. This chemical (named\nDC-62\n) was a massive failure, ending up being just as lethal as the virus. This left large areas of the Capital uninhabitable and caused many looters and factions to not risk entry. That meant that high-tier weapons and gear were left behind and are now up for grabs by anyone who is willing to enter. Unfortunately, some of this gear is contaminated and must be extracted to be cleaned before it can be used. Any agent who is nearby and has questionable loyalties may decide that they'd rather have the loot for themselves and go rogue in an attempt to claim it.\nGameplay\nThe Dark Zone is the only location in which players can roam solo or in a group in an openly PVP environment without limits. In the Dark Zone, players will be able to do challenges, landmarks, take down enemy faction bosses for loot. Similar to\nTom Clancy's The Division\n,\nplayers will need to extract the contaminated loot before it can be used in the open world.\nNormalization\nIn the Division 2, the three Dark Zones in Washington D.C. utilize \"normalization\" to level the player field. Normalization reduces the peaks and valleys between players who have high survivability or high damage output. Normalization only affects Base Amor and Weapon Damage. AI are not exempt from normalization either; they adhere to the same normalization rules players do.\nMatchmaking in the Dark Zones occurs in two separate brackets. On the one side, players are matched in level buckets (1-10, 11-20, and 21-30) and normalized to the same power level. On the other side, all players who have reached World Tier are matched together and normalized to the same World Tier. For players above the normalized power level, bonus statistics are applied to reward you for your time.\nGoing Rogue\nPlayers can choose to go\nRogue\nto engage in PvP activities with other players.\nDark Zone Checkpoints\nDark Zone Checkpoint\nDark Zones now have DZ Checkpoints that are armed with automated turrets that guard the entrance of every Dark Zone, and they protect newcomers from\nRogue\nagents or enemies.\nInvaded Dark Zones\nBlack Tusk faction\nOnce players reach\nWorld Tier 1\n, Dark Zones will start becoming Invaded. The dangerous end-game faction\nBlack Tusk\nwill periodically move in one of the three Dark Zones and give you a challenge.\nLandmarks\nAs you explore the Dark Zone you will find\nLandmarks\n. These Landmarks can be special streets, stores, or just random abandoned buildings. These\nLandmarks\nare spots where you find strong elite opponents and also named enemies that guarantee good loot-drops for one and usually guard one of the Dark Zone Chests.\nLandmarks\nevolved over time. First, you just needed to clear them and later they got multiple waves. The\nLandmarks\nalso provide different challenges: Normal and Hard difficulty.\nWhen someone clears a\nLandmark\n, you can see it on the map and you also get a timer indicating how long ago it was cleared. This way you know that a player should be in the area.\nExtractions\nRogue Agent prepares the ambush\nThe only way to permanently keep contaminated loot and Dark Zone resources from the Dark Zone is to go through the extraction process. Each Dark Zone has three areas where you can call an extraction. Any player or group member can call the extraction but only one group can call an extraction in such an area. If an extraction is called, a clear visible flair is fired and the players and NPCs in the area will be alerted to the extraction. You will have a clear countdown of how long it takes for the helicopter to arrive.\nWhen the chopper has arrived, another timer will start and every member of the group can attach the contaminated loot to the rope that is dropped. Other players/groups may also attach their loot to the cable and fill up the remaining loot slots (there are 4 slots).\nOnce the timer is over, the helicopter takes the contaminated loot away. After that, you can pick up the decontaminated items from any Stash.\nThis extraction process is for loot only; the player will remain in the Dark Zone and can continue their search for loot.\nIt's important to note that, until the helicopter has left, other players can cut the rope and drop all the loot that is attached to it, allowing anyone to pick it up again and steal it. So it recommended to remain at the extraction and wait until the chopper has left - because only then is your loot safe.\nCutting the rope will turn you\nRogue\n, so expect players to protect their loot when this happens.\nSafe Rooms\nInside each Dark Zone, you can find a\nSafe Room\n. This Safe Room is personal to your group and can\u00b4t be entered by other players. This Safe Room has multiple exits that allow you to leave the place from a different exit. The Safe Room is easily recognizable thanks to the big circular marker on the wall. Once you enter the Safe Room, your ammo will be restocked as well.\nDark Zone Rank\nPlayer progression is split between Player Level and Dark Zone Rank. While the Player Level defines your progression as a character, your health pool, and what weapon and items you can equip, the Dark Zone Rank is more like a rank system.\nDark Zone XP is earned via Supply Drops, completing or hijacking extractions, revives, killing\nRogues\nor agents, or going\nManhunt\n. Basically some form of interaction with other players. Dying will cause you to lose some Dark Zone XP and potentially rank down. Currently, the maximum Dark Zone Rank is 50.\nThe Dark Zone Rank is also tied to the\nDark Zone Perks\nthat can be unlocked at the\nBase of Operations\n. One Perk becomes available every 5 DZ Ranks and if you drop down in rank, those perks may become deactivated again.\nDZ Supply Drops\nThis is a returning activity from\nTom Clancy's The Division\n. In regular intervals, you get a Dark Zone Supply Drop that will land somewhere in the Dark Zone. It will be guarded by strong NPCs and once you have cleared the area \u2013 you also need to claim the Supply Drop. When you claim it, you get the reward for the group or you can steal it for yourself and go\nRogue\nin the process. Those Supply Drops will be broadcasted over the map, so all players will know if the Supply Drop is being or was claimed.\nSupply Drops can happen in\nLandmarks\nthat are not active and the fights for these can feature multiple bosses or factions. This will not only raise the difficulty, but it will bring more variety into the game loop and makes the drops less predictable. Also, more bosses and factions mean a higher chance or contaminated loot, so fighting for these drops will be more lucrative.\nDark Zones Areas\nEvery Dark Zone has their own distinct environment, landmarks, and challenges. There are different challenges every time the player plays in the Dark Zone.\nDark Zone East\nLocated near the East Mall, Dark Zone East was a military-occupied area. An explosion at a containment storage containing\nDC-62\nled to massive casualties, forcing whatever was left of the\nJTF\nand the volunteers to evacuate the area and lead to the area being walled off. The wall off attempt was successful.\nDark Zone South\nLocated in Waterfront, Dark Zone South was the primary storage facility site for DC-62, as well as the back-up military base after DZ East was evacuated. A flood breached the vaults containing DC-62 and spilled it across the whole zone. The military and scientists within the zone were once again forced to evacuate and wall off the whole zone.\nDark Zone West\nLocated in Georgetown, the town willfully allowed the government to come in and fumigate the town with DC-62, long before the lethal effects were fully known. The area was walled off shortly after the first few deaths of the toxin happened, and is now a \"ghost town\".\nDark Zone Vendors\nDark Zone Vendor\nOutside of each Dark Zone's entrance is a\nDark Zone Vendor\nwho offers a rotating selection of items for sale, including at least one Dark Zone-exclusive item (barring\nRaid\n-exclusive\nExotic\nitems); however, they will only accept payment in\nDZ Resources\n.\nDZ Resources\ncan be obtained by deconstructing Contaminated items (requires extraction) or looting specific crates inside the Dark Zones (no extraction required).\nEach of the three Dark Zone Vendors have separate inventories. They will also buy items like other vendors, but only pay in\nE-Credits.\nGallery\nConcept art of a Non-Rogue Division agent and a Rogue Division agent exchanging gunfire between each other\nTwo Division agents entering a Dark Zone Checkpoint\nA Division agent extracting an item in the extraction zone by helicopter\nConcept art of a Division agent requesting for extraction whilst being protected by other two Division agents\nConcept art of Division agents standing around the entrance to Dark Zone South\nA Division agent in Dark Zone East getting ready to ambush a couple of enemies\nDivision agents in the Dark Zone in a deadlock situation with other Division agents\nTrivia\nPrior to\nTitle Update 8\n, Invaded Dark Zones were named Occupied Dark Zones, where gear normalization was deactivated. The update applied normalization to Invaded Dark Zones as well, meaning the only remaining difference in Invaded Dark Zones is the presence of Black Tusk.\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division 2"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Raids | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Raids\nare a new type of mission in\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n.

Arriving at the server room, they listen to the file and a revelation came about. Apparently, Bardon Schaeffer and Faye Lau were secretely working together to help the Division to warn them about the greater threat. Schaeffer went to Coney Island to act as bait for the agents so they could capture him. And once they do, he'd share what he knows about the Hunters. Lau had doubts, but he reassured that this is the only possible angle they could work on without being compromised. While Schaeffer gets captured, Lau focuses on putting \"Chickenhawk\" off the board\nIn fact, Lau was not a traitor and Schaeffer is not the enemy.\nA cutscene plays out, Agent Kelso visits Manny Ortega to let him know she decrypted Faye's files. Manny was still upset about Faye's defection and her assassination of President Andrew Ellis.

She made her voice-only debut during the\nBardon Schaeffer\nManhunt\nwhen she discussed about failure in a radio message to the aforementioned. As the oldest child of the late affluent industrialist\nAlexey Sokolov\nand the older half-sister of\ndisavowed\nDivision agent,\nFelix \"Kestrel\" Sokolov\n, it is suggested that Natalya founded the Black Tusk PMC using her family's fortune for reasons unknown. Vague details about why Sokolova founded Black Tusk are known, except much of Black Tusk's early but unmasked doings at the beginning of the game suggest that Sokolova is the heavy liable for the events of\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n.\nContents\n1\nBiography\n1.1\nA necessary back-up\n1.2\nRebuilding an alliance\n1.3\nManipulation\n1.4\nTreating the hostages\n1.5\nCapturing \"Cassandra\"\n1.6\nA recovery attempt and The Ark Protocol\n2\nPersonality\n3\nOther Media\n3.1\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Firewall\n4\nGallery\n5\nTrivia\n6\nMissions\n7\nAppearances\nBiography\nNatalya Sokolova's early life is shrouded in mystery. However, it is stated during the\nKestrel Manhunt\nthat she was raised in Russia while her younger brother Felix was sent to the United States at a young age by\nAlexey Sokolov\n, their industrialist father. After the defeat of the\nRecruiter\n, Sokolova stated in a\npropaganda broadcast\nthat she spent most of her adolescence in a Swiss boarding school. She claims, while it granted her certain advantages it was a lonely and isolated time for the young heiress. After Alexey died, Natalya inherited her father's fortune and used it to put her brother through his education. It is possible that she had heard of the existence of the\nStrategic Homeland Division\nbefore the\noutbreak\nsince her brother was recruited as an agent. Although she denied that in another broadcast, this information should be treated with care.\nAfter the outbreak, Sokolova kept in touch with her brother, and put him in a safe house to ensure his safety. She also pulled the strings from behind the curtain to ensure the\nBlack Tusk\nassumes control over the United States government.\nA necessary back-up\nBefore\nSchaeffer\n's operation with his\nrogue agents\n, he contacted Sokolova in regard to rogue Division agent\nFaye Lau\n. Sokolova reminded Schaeffer that he brought in Lau, so she was his responsibility. Sokolova also warned Schaeffer not to fail her.\nAfter hearing Schaeffer's concerns about Lau and her Rogue Agents, Natalya contacted her secret partner,\nCalvin McManus\n, Secretary of Homeland Security and secret Commander of the\nHunters\n, to ask for support, as Schaeffer couldn't be in two places at once and these Rogues didn't seem like a very worthwhile effort. McManus asked if she needed him to send his \"cleanup crew\" for the job, to which Natalya declined, saying that all she needed was one single operative to gain access and assess if it was worth continuing Faye's operation. McManus sent one of his Hunters, codename \"\nDeceit\n\", to stalk and observe Bardon's rogues, as well as to contact Schaeffer and send him encrypted reports on their situation.\nOne by one, Schaeffer's rogues would be stalked by a Hunter operative, who would try to assassinate them after, only for them to be killed by Division agents who were also after them instead. One of these rogues was\nLinette \"Dusk\" Edwards\n, who was also affiliated with the\nTrue Sons\n. During Dusk's time as Schaeffer's subordinate, Sokolova had made a deal with\nGeneral Anderson\nof the True Sons to establish peace between their two organizations, which would be broken with Dusk's death, as Anderson saw his alliance with the Black Tusk as a liability due to their incompetence and the sheer number of Rogue Division agents in their ranks.\nAfter Schaeffer's rogue Division agent cell was neutralized and his location exposed, a Division agent stormed\nConey Island Amusement Park\nto neutralize him. McManus's Hunter was present on-site, either to protect Schaeffer or, as he suspected himself, possibly kill him. The Hunter was defeated (despite a tough fight), and Sokolova checked in with Schaeffer asking about the status of the Hunter on open comms, in which he told her that the Hunter was neutralized. She then told him to clean up B.T.S.U.'s mess with his B.T.S.U. guards on-hand, but he was defeated alongside the rest of the B.T.S.U. unit on site.  An unconscious Schaeffer was apprehended by a team sent in by\nAgent Kelso\n, though he was in critical condition.\nThe very next day, despite the unfortunate events of Schaeffer's apprehension and the Hunter's death, both at the hands of a Division Agent, Natalya contacted Cal to thank him for the backup he sent, seemingly happy that he didn't ask for anything in return. However, Cal does proceed to ask for something: due to one of his men getting killed by the Division the previous night, and the difficulty to find suitable candidates for his \"unit\", he asks Natalya to send him a few potential replacements for his lost Hunter. Natalya lists a couple of potential candidates, including her brother,\nFelix \"Kestrel\" Sokolov\n,\nBridgette \"Viper\" Douglas\n,\nDustin \"Magnus\" Xavier\n,\nAlicia \"Circe\" Coswald\nand, despite his young age,\nJack Bonney\n, with the latter being the first one chosen by Calvin.\nRebuilding an alliance\nAfter Bonney was taken out by Division agents with the help of True Sons\nCaptain Lewis\nat the\nJefferson Trade Center\n, General Anderson attempted to re-establish his alliance with Sokolova and the Black Tusk. As they arranged their meeting and the specifics of their partnership, Natalya sends an advance team to carry out the logistics for Anderson, composed of B.T.S.U. operatives\nMathias \"Trig\" Schneider\n,\nShawn \"Micro\" Clarke\n,\nSandra \"Chirpy\" Patterson\nand\nMitchell \"Lucky\" Woods\n. Sokolova, due to Lewis's intervention with Bonney's Hunter recruitment test a few weeks prior, would start to get suspicious of him, telling Anderson to keep an eye on the Captain should he notice anything unusual. Later, she would share a drone recording that incriminated Lewis, as he was meeting up with\nManny Ortega\nto help The Division. Concerned for his operation, Anderson tasks \"Chirpy\" with apprehending Lewis and trying to uncover more \"rats\" (traitors) amongst them. As their advance would be taken down one-by-one, Anderson and Sokolova set up a meeting at the\nPentco Fairview Power Plant\n, where Natalya would give the General 2 B.T.S.U. operatives as a security detail,\nNico \"Brain\" McPherson\nand\nHank \"Bough\" Bibichev\n. Division agents, learning the location of the meeting, which was also where Lewis was being held captive, storm the Plant, looking to save the Captain and neutralize Anderson before the Black Tusk's fleet of hovercrafts could arrive.\nThe agents take down \"Brain\" and rescue Lewis, but instead of going with them, the Captain runs off to try and capture Anderson. Unfortunately for them, the True Sons' General was already boarding Natalya's hovercraft by the time he arrived at the docks, so Lewis and the agents face off and kill multiple True Sons and Black Tusk operatives, including \"Bough\" himself, while waiting for extraction.\nManipulation\nAfter Anderson had been successfully rescued by her B.T.S.U., the alliance between True Sons and Black Tusk had been fully established, with Sokolova mobilizing a team comprised of five operatives coming from both organizations. This team, led by\nZachary \"Stovepipe\" Beattie\n, was composed of\nCharles \"Chunks\" Crawford\n,\nLieutenant Bantam\n,\nMort \"Cursed\" Kellogg\nand\nBeatrice \"Auntie\" Kaplan\n, their goal was to gather information on the White House and it's surroundings, in an attempt to locate Schaeffer and find out his status. Meanwhile, Sokolova would ask Chunks and Stovepipe about radiation poisoning, which would raise a few red flags in the latter's eyes. She would then task Cursed with fully recruiting Auntie to the Black Tusk (which he was eventually successful at) as she had the right skillset to uncover more traitors amongst the True Sons' ranks. As rumors began spreading of a chemical attack involving\nOutcasts\nand Rogue Agents in St. Louis, Stovepipe raised suspicions of Sokolova's involvement in the creation of the dirty bombs used in the supposed attack, this would eventually lead to him confronting her on the subject and wanting to leave the Black Tusk.\nAs his whole team had been hunted down and killed by the Division, Stovepipe went to finish his work at\nConey Island\nfor a supposed \"carpet bombing\" of New York, Wally quickly mobilized the Division agents to go after him and prevent the attack. Upon their arrival on the island, the agents would soon notice the lack of enemy presence on-site, quickly rushing through the structures, they would soon find Stovepipe's dead body, having been killed by Sokolova to prevent his imminent betrayal. As they fought their way through the island against multiple waves of Black Tusk drones and\nWarhounds\n, the agents would come face to face with one of Ortiz Robotics' deadliest creations:\nSparkle\n, a unique Warhound model equipped with a powerful flamethrower. After a tough battle, the agents extracted back to Washington, as the White House was under attack by Sokolova's men, in the execution of their plans to rescue Schaeffer. Though they were unsuccessful at rescuing their asset, the Black Tusk had managed to not only kill Frederick Lewis via\na Hunter operative\npresent on-site, but also capture multiple people, including the likes of\nJohn Yazzie\n,\nEva Garcia\n,\nLauren Fong\n,\nMitchell Billings\n,\nMari Singh\n,\nVikram Malik\n,\nCindy McAllister,\nVitaly Tchernenko\n, and\nHarlan Lloyd\n.\nTreating the hostages\nThrough her actions, Sokolova realized having a powerful military force wasn't enough, she needed the support from the people, so she found ways to treat the hostages as nicely as possible, giving each of them tasks that fit their backgrounds, in an attempt to demonstrate a good facade for the Black Tusk by rebuilding society. Later, after the agents had successfully rescued Mari Singh, Sokolova received a call from one of her subordinates, saying the asset was in place and awaiting orders.\nNot long after that, Division agents went to a rescue Birdie in Camp White Oak after recovering four more hostages under Black Tusk's custody. During the conflict, she was listening to the agents fighting off the Black Tusk, True Sons, and the Recruiter. After the Recruiter was killed thanks to Birdie, she promptly started broadcasting propaganda in order to sway civilians to her side.\nCapturing \"Cassandra\"\nA while later, Sokolova sent Black Tusk and True Sons forces to the Stranded Tanker in Lower Manhattan with explicit orders to capture\n\"Cassandra\"\n. However, Division agents would get a headstart and eliminate their enemies, including a\nHunter\nwho was sent to avenge his\ncomrade\n. As such, Sokolova's attempt to capture Cassandra has failed, leaving her very frustrated.\nWhile Sokolova is not heard nor seen in\nFirst Rogue\n, it is revealed via Aaron Keener that she is a member of The Cabal, a shadow organization of powerful people. This would further explain the recording file that she left on a Hunter done in the aftermath of\nReign of Fire\n, in which she made it clear that D.C, the United States, and the entire world belongs to them. And that they're entitled to take what's rightfully theirs.\nA recovery attempt and The Ark Protocol\nSokolova was heard again in\nBurden of Truth\n,\nwhere she alongside General Anderson were overseeing the True Sons on Roosevelt Island who were sent there to recover the Mobile SHD Server that was left behind by Rogue Agent\nAlani Kelso\n. Despite the efforts from the True Sons (as well as possible help from a squad of 4 Hunters), it all went to hell when Division agents decimated both True Sons officers, the Gadwall brothers, and recovered the server. Sokolova was unimpressed by the True Sons' failure, so she called off the operation, and told Anderson that his troops efforts were very disappointing.\nThroughout the whole journey to follow clues from Kelso, Division agents learned that Sokolova was after The Ark Protocol (aka The Football). It is not explicitly said what it is, but given the naming, it's possiblynuclear missile bunkers or simply underground government bunkers to survive a nuclear winter. President Ellis had the security clearance for the Ark, though he wiped it from his smart watch  given it to Faye Lau, since he didn't Nat to have access. And the agents would learn that eventually from the ECHO they played in Roosevelt Island.\nIn addition to learning the truth, the agents recovered additional comms, with one comm in particular involving Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas' personal history with Sokolova, as it first had her venting her frustrations about Mackenzie Meret at the start with Aaron Keener. And when the discussion turned towards the Black Tusk's CEO, Viper talked about Nat's flaws, being very repressed and insincere. To clarify her point, Viper mentions how Nat often tries to fulfill people's hopes and dreams through insidious use of ISAC's database, which she saw as both amazing and terrifying as while people's dreams and desires can be amazing, they are often vile and horrible.\nPersonality\nNatalya could be best described as multi-layered. She presents herself as affable and considerate, but her true colors are shown to be vindictive, spiteful, and condescending. As the leader of Black Tusk, she expects complete obedience from her subordinates and does not tolerate having them disobey her orders. Despite benefitting from the Hunters at Calvin McManus' disposal, she has a somewhat antagonistic relationship with the Secretary of Homeland Security.\nWhile her full motives for wanting to take over control of the United States are yet to be known, it is clear that she wants to win over the hearts and minds of the civilians caught in the crossfire of the conflict between her Black Tusk and the Division. Knowing how desperate they are for the country to get back on track, she spreads her propaganda (which were added after the end of Y5S2: Puppeters) on Black Tusk's broadcast in hopes to sway them on her side. However, her true desire is to have absolute control over the country, and possibly the entire world.\nShe has somewhat of a negative relationship to her father, Alexey, due to running off to America and marrying another woman, leaving her mother and forcing herself to handle the family business in Russia. This also includes her relationship with her brother, Felix \"Kestrel\" Sokolov. Even though she speaks fondly of him in her propaganda broadcasts, it is anything but positive. In fact, in one of the comms from Paradise Lost Incursion, her casual attitude over his death led to Mackenzie Meret suspecting that she purposely led him to his death.\nAs established in comms from\nBurden of Truth\n,\nNatalya Sokolova is narcissistic and sociopathic. As examples given by Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas in the comm \"Red Light\", she's accepting of personnel losses in Black Tusk, she won't tolerate anyone questioning her or her systems, she expects total obedience from those under her and sees her systems as infallible. Those traits stemmed when she grew up, as no one dared to tell her no when she wanted something.\nShe is also very repressed to the point that Douglas considers her the saddest person she's ever met. Despite appearing as perfect to others, it's a facade and her way of trying to fulfill people's dreams is mostly through data and tech. In addition, her constant competition with Mackenzie Meret affected Mack heavily as it caused a rift to her friends, with Douglas pinning the blame on Sokolova, since she often had to make excuses for Mack's negative behavior.\nIn simpler terms, the Division's nemesis is led by a narcissistic and emotionally repressed woman.\nOther Media\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Firewall\nNatalya Sokolova is mentioned in Chapter Thirteen of\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Firewall\n, where she is listed as an associate of Brody Teague, CEO of the Teague Technical Group (T-Tec), who refers to Black Tusk as her \"pet project\".\nGallery\nSokolova seen alongside\nGeneral Anderson\n,\nCharles \"Chunks\" Crawford\n,\nMort \"Cursed\" Kellogg\nand\nLieutenant Bantam\nin the Season 11 trailer\nSokolova looming

After he attended Rutgers, he bounced around several tech startups, never staying anywhere for long. He settled in Manhattan long enough to find a wife but lost her when her office fell in the World Trade Center North Tower collapse on the morning of September 11, 2001.\nAfterwards, motivated by revenge against the terrorists but embittered by a disdain for what he considered the tepid response of the U.S. government, he joined the Last Man Battalion private military company instead of the U.S. Armed Forces. In 2003, his LMB work took him to Iraq where he served as an engineering contractor. He left Iraq and the company after becoming the sole survivor of a harrowing roadside ambush that decimated his team. Grappling with the enormous burden of survivor's guilt, Rhodes retired from military contract work and returned to live in Manhattan.\nEvents of\nTom Clancy's The Division\nAfter the\nGreen Poison\noutbreak, Rhodes offered his services to the newly consolidated Joint Task Force and quickly rose to become its chief engineer. When a local power outage affecting the JTF Base of Operations was traced to generator failures in the\nSubway Morgue\n, Rhodes led a team down to investigate, but then went dark himself. Thanks to a daring rescue op by\nSecond-Wave Division\nagents, he managed to fend off a\nCleaner\nassault led by a union boss named Benchley. Rhodes reactivated the power grid, sending juice back to JTF's Tech Wing.\nAfter returning to the Base of Operations, Rhodes guided the agent to fix the power in the\nTimes Square\n,\nWarrenGate Power Plant\n, and\nRooftop Comms Relay\n, successfully prevented power outage on the island as well as restored power on the island.\nWhen\na friend of\nRhodes inside the Last Man Battalion defected, he called Rhodes to send a squad to get him to the Base of Operations, in exchange for Intel on the LMB. Rhodes then sent a 3 men JTF squad to retrieve him. Unfortunately, the LMB found out about the betrayal and sent a squad to kill the JTF squad and the traitor himself. In desperation, Rhodes asked the agent to aid him in rescuing his friend. The agent then followed the\nECHOs\n, to where his friend was, and successfully rescued him by eliminating all the surrounding LMB forces. Rhodes then thank the agent and sent another JTF squad to retrieve him back to base.\nDuring an incursion at the\nPort Control Transit Terminal\nagainst the Cleaners and their new weapon,\nBenitez\ncalled Rhodes to aid the squad of Division agents in destroying Dragon One. After multiple attempts, Rhodes successfully destroyed the weapon by dropping a giant metal pipe on it.\nEvents of\nTom Clancy's The Division 2: Warlords of New York\nPrior to the events of\nWarlords of New York\n, Rhodes is sick of the\nDivision\nand their lack of accountability, decided to leave and establish a new civilian settlement in\nLower Manhattan\ncalled\nHaven\n. Later on, the New York City Hall was attacked by\nAaron Keener\n, resulting in massive casualties to the JTF and Division forces stationed there. Rhodes allows\nFaye Lau\nand\nRoy Benitez\ninto Haven, albeit unhappily as he still holds a grudge against The Division and Lau. Rhodes' low opinion of Division agents is shown when the player shows up in Haven, much to Rhodes disapproval, vowing that if the \"blood and violence\" of the Division followed them into Haven, he wouldn't forgive them.\nDuring the Warlords campaign, while the player progresses in hunting down Keener, Rhodes continues to begrudgingly help out, if only to have the player leave quickly once Keener is eliminated. This shows most prominently during the\nTombs\nmission, in which Rhodes states\n\"... should be done in no time thanks to\nISAC\n. You don't deserve this technology. You really don't.\"\nAfter the events of\nLiberty Island\n, where Keener is eliminated by the player and Lau is revealed to have gone rogue to assist the\nBlack Tusk\n, Rhodes states, during a conversation between\nAgent Kelso\nand Benitez, that he never trusted Lau. He does, however, now trust the player more than when they arrived. When the player talks to Rhodes after the final cinematic of the campaign, he states that\n\"you can't trust a system without checks and balances,\"\nand that the abuse of power and corruption of said unchecked power\n\"happened to Keener, it happened to Lau, it can happen to anyone.\"\nAt some point, he and Benitez learn from Kelso that Lau was never a traitor and that she was working undercover in Black Tusk to aid the Division, including her insurance policy. While Benitez no longer holdes resentment towards the fallen agent, Rhodes still feels bitterness about it. After the community of\nMeret Estate\nwere rescued by Division agents, Rhodes welcomed\nMackenzie Meret\nand some of her community's survivors to Haven. When Meret asks why they have a picture of Aaron Keener, Rhodes and Benitez discuss Keener with the former socialite and her history with him.\nIt is not known if Rhodes is aware of the fact that Keener is alive, Kelso allied with him, and that Faye Lau worked with Keener secretly against Black Tusk and the\nHunters\n. But considering his current feelings about Lau, there's a good chance he won't be happy about it.\nPersonality\nSince losing his wife on 9/11, Paul Rhodes has assiduously avoided intimate relationships. His experiences working for the\nLast Man Battalion\nhave turned him cynical and somewhat \"twitchy\" with an odd penchant for hardcore conspiracy theories. Rhodes is certain that powerful interests of the \"deep state\" variety lurk behind the scenes, manipulating the events surrounding the\nsmallpox outbreak\n. This unfortunate worldview also explains his lingering trust issues regarding the\nDivision\n.\nTruly unconcerned with appearances and painfully blunt, Rhodes is also widely considered to be \"scary smart\" according to the Division's personnel dossier.

She grew up on a secluded estate in the Scottish Highlands. After attending university, Douglas completed an eight-year stint in the\nSpecial Air Service\nbefore taking a position in D&H as a logistics and supply specialist. When\nGreen Poison\nhit, she was immediately recruited by\nBlack Tusk\n, and despite her father's objections she joined Black Tusk.\nHistory\nPrior to Tom Clancy's The Division 2\nBridgette grew as typical of children of rich and powerful folks, living in the shadow of her father's company. Due to her upbringing, she was expected to act as the perfect daughter in the higher echelon of society throughout, giving her father and his company many contracts. During her upbringing, she struck a friendship with\nMackenzie Meret\nand\nNatalya Sokolova\n.\nHer act got the attention of\nCalvin McManus\n, who gave her a smart watch and was given basic SHD training. She was also selected to be part of the Hunter program. When the Green Poison outbreak hit the country, she wasn't activated as a Division agent, leading her to be immediately recruited by Black Tusk. Not long after her recruitment, Bridge attempted to convince Mackenzie to join Black Tusk. However, Mack wanted nothing to do with Black Tusk nor with Natalya Sokolova. The fact that Douglas was also in allegiance with the PMC soured her friendship with Mack.\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nHowever, she'd have second guesses about her allegiance with Black Tusk, presumably due to learning about  Sokolova's true intentions. Wanting to set things right, she found herself in contact with Aaron Keener. During the events of Division 2's base story, she fed him intel about her father's whereabouts as well as intel on President Ellis. It was her intel about Ellis's residence in Camp White Oak that had \"Luna\" leak intel about the president's whereabouts to the Division, allowing Keener and his rogues time to work on deploying the Rogue network.\nWarlords of New York\nDuring the events of Warlords of New York, Douglas was coerced by Keener to act as the honeypot to Faye Lau, convincing the latter to join Black Tusk so they could undermine the organization and the Hunters. It took some time, but Lau managed to infiltrate Black Tusk. Throughout the course of WONY's campaign, she questioned Keener about letting his lieutenants die, though she'd be surprised when she learns that Theo Parnell is alive thanks to deceiving ISAC with a decoy and a copy of ANNA, tricking the Division into believing he's dead.\nAfter Warlords of New York\nAfter the events of WONY, Douglas still corresponded with Keener, revealing that due to Mackenzie's refusal in joining Black Tusk, she basically signed her death warrant. The two discussed about Mack with Keener having romantic admiration for her, prompting Douglas to call him a lovesick puppy. She remarked that if he and Mack got together, Sokolova would try to get rid of him since he's not the first suitor for Mack, calling Nat a Hydra who's each head is happy to get rid of the competition.\nAt some point, Douglas reached out to Major Amanda Xander, her ex-girlfriend, to try and talk things with Faye Lau. Xander wanted nothing to do with Lau as she held a grudge against the agent, even informing General Anderson about Black Tusk's involvement, warning Natalya Sokolova to not interfere further after he cut ties with the organization.\nDouglas also shared intel to Keener on Sokolova's control of the manufacturing process, which she has complete control \"in all the ways that matters\". She felt a bit uncomfortable over Keener's change of heart, in which he retorted that they all have to evolve if they want to survive. Douglas admitted that she was actively trying to be away from Nat's leash, and Keener tried to convince her to stop \"wearing the Black Tusk girdle\". However, Douglas preferred to stay as \"Operation Cassandra\" depended on her staying in Nat's good graces.\nEnd of Watch\nLater on, she got put in a team with Faye Lau, where she'd work in logistics for Lau's operation. The two struck a relationship, though it's unknown if Douglas told her she's part of the Hunter program. Regardless, when Lau and her lieutenants got on the Division's radar, agents would hunt Douglas down in Southwest of Washington, D.C. and end her.\nFirst Rogue\nThroughout various comms collected during the trials set by Aaron Keener, the agents learn more about Bridgette Douglas and her partnership with Keener. The comms first delves into her father, Charles Douglas, and her love-hate relationship she has for him given how she felt mistreated by him when he groomed her to be the perfect daughter to squeeze rich people for his business, and her father's position in the White House.\nThen it later delves into other topics, starting Douglas sharing President Ellis' location at Camp White Oak to Keener, allowing him to share it to\n\"Luna\"\nto buy time in deploying the Rogue Network nationally. Later comms delve into Douglas informing Keener that Mackenzie Meret \"signing\" her \"death warrant\" for refusing to join Natalya Sokolova's Black Tusk, and teasing him for his crush on the former socialite, then sharing what she knows about Nat's control over the manufacturing process in her organization while actively trying to look for ways to get herself out of the CEO's leash.\nAll in all, the comms revealed Douglas changing sides as she wanted nothing to do with Black Tusk and partnering with Keener to help him out in his mission to stop Black Tusk and the Hunters.\nShades of Red\nWhile she wasn't heard in the comms intercepted by SHD Agents during their trail to find\n\"Glasses\"\n, Bridgette Douglas was heard in various comms intercepted during their incursions in the Descent simulation facility, where she was first heard giving reports to Natalya Sokolova about the state of things in Coney Island, Lower Manhattan, and Brooklyn as part of her \"recon mission\".\nBut for the most part, the comms involved Douglas talking with Aaron Keener about recruiting people for his settlement. A number of them happened to be members from the Castle Settlement the Division agents rescued while they were under Black Tusk's custody. Though there two people that weren't members of the Castle, Maral McCarthy and Rodney Bishop. Douglas was apprehensive about having Maral as the social director of Keener's settlement, given she's pregnant with Theo's child and claiming the settlement is ground zero, which turned into a discussion that the former friendship Keener had with Calvin McManus.\nThen came Rodney Bishop, who was hired by Keener to be in charge of the supplies, which Douglas had misgivings as she thinks Bishop is a fanboy who's in love with the idea of who Keener is. Though, she does admit that having someone like Bishop spreading the gospel of his hero helps things for the settlement.\nAfter the Division rescued Parnell for extraction at the NOA HQ and dealing with the Hyenas, they recovered 4 comms during the assault. One comm, in particular, involved Parnell reviewing the Hunter roster which confirmed that Bridgette Douglas is indeed a Hunter. This comm took place few months ago, as Douglas was Keener's ace in the hole to help Faye Lau infilitrate Black Tusk. While Parnell was apprehensive at first, he was convinced when Keener vouched for Douglas, remarking that she kept him out of trouble a number of times.\nInterestingly enough, when discussing about Birdie Malik with Keener, Douglas mentioned that Birdie alongside her adopted brother Vikram were sent to the Castle Settlement which happened during the events of\nPuppeteers\n. This implies that Douglas survived her encounter with the Division agents in Washington, D.C. using the hologram technology that Keener and Parnell procured from the Descent simulation program. If so, her current whereabouts are unknown.\nBurden of Truth\nDuring the Division's latest incursion to the Descent simulation facility, Bridgette Douglas was heard in a comm between her and Keener, where she confirmed that Bardon Schaeffer was alive and sent to the White House after his tussle against the agents in Coney Island. However, because Schaeffer was in a coma due to the injuries he sustained, he couldn't deliver Faye Lau's message in the White House, and Douglas expressed that\nshe was set to be next in the Division's hit-list.\nAdditionally, Douglas would be heard again through the intel the agents are recovering during their trail to find Agent Kelso in D.C, as she had a role in the whole mess with Lau, the Cassandra mission, and Bardon Schaeffer.\nHoney Pot\nAfter following the first intel in East Mall, Division agents intercepted a comm between Aaron Keener and Douglas, after the latter met with Faye Lau. Douglas was hesitant to share the truth, but Keener encouraged her to be honest as no relationship based on lies ever survives. This changed to a personal conversation about Keener's envy of the human connection he saw in the Morretis, Theo and Maral, and his crush on Mackenzie Meret. Of course, Douglas seemed to prefer sarcastic megalomaniac Keener over the emotionally mature Keener.\nMeet Cute\nAfter they followed the second intel in Southwest, Division agents intercepted a comm between Douglas and Keener, where she shared a bit of her conversation with Faye Lau during their meeting to Keener. Keene admitted that Lau didn't expect Douglas having attraction to women, which she proudly admitted though mentioned that wasn't good for her father's business, which Keener disliked about. She then asked Keener of his opinion towards Lau, where he believes she's dangerous for her, though Douglas retorted she wouldn't betray them. Keener agreed, but recommended Douglas to not sleep with Lau. Douglas argues that'd blow her cover, and commented that being in the Black Tusk is like living in the Olympic Village, where beautiful people in peak condition often sleep together because they don't have anything to do between fights.\nKeener conceded to his friend's point, telling her to do what she to do, but stay focused nonetheless.\nThe Mission\nWhen Division agents followed the third intel, they intercept a comm that involved a discussion between Douglas and Keener, where the former admits that she'd understand and wouldn't be disappointed if Lau refused to take the mission to kill President Ellis. Keener argues that's less extreme than what she's already done. Douglas, on the other hand, argues that it'll involve a lot of roleplaying and an uncomfortable outfit. Moreover, Lau will have to talk to Ellis, be respectful to him, and make him feel like the most important person in the world, which Keener admits was a challenge as Ellis was an idiot, which Douglas also agreed upon.\nStill, given that Ellis was the only who had access to \"The Ark Protocol\" and was yet to resign or name his successor, that emphasized the importance of Lau's mission. Though, Douglas preferred calling it \"the football\" as she finds the clandestine naming stuff hard to follow and kind of annoying.\nGreen Light\nWhen agents of the Division followed the fourth intel, they interceped a comm where Douglas confirms to Keener that Faye Lau is committed in her mission, playing the politics. And if necessary, kill President Ellis, especially she refused to call him POTUS. In addition, she'll go through\nNatalya Sokolova'\ns tests for the rebuilt BTSU, test her skills as a leader and antagonise the hell out of\nBardon Schaeffer\nfor Nat's pleasure.\nKeener was confused at the last part, since he thought Schaeffer was Nat's most loyal soldier. However, Douglas mentions that Schaeffer got kicked from Ellis' security detail, and Nat had to solve a problem that he created. And in Nat's mind, that made Schaeffer her sworn enemy.\nDouglas would go further in exemplifying Nat's flaws. She doesn't tolerate being questioned or breaking her system. Efficiency at all costs. Acceptable loss is personnel. And as far as Natalya is concerned, her systems are infallible and cannot be questioned.\nKeener commented that Douglas makes Nat sound like a psychopath, and Douglas wondered if Nat is a narcissist or undiagnosed autistic, but doesn't really know. Whatever the case, Douglas vented further about Nat, mentioning that she never admits she's ever done anything wrong, which was more exemplified when no one told Nat no during her childhood, which turned her into a privileged asshole as an adult. Lastly, Douglas mentions Natalya as a prime example of a privileged asshole who's given unlimited resources and a private army, which sets the picture for the current situation that Douglas and Keener were dealing with.\nRed Light\nPrior to\nSchaeffer going to Coney Island to act as bait for the Division\n, Douglas tried to convince him not to go through with it. Schaeffer is still all in on this, believing it can't be for nothing and mentioned that she's the one who got him into this. Douglas was frustrated about this predicament, and expressed that it's not fair, considering that she, Schaeffer, and Lau are gonna be meeting death. Schaeffer argued that it's the quality of time that matters, and encouraged her to spend as much time as possible with her girlfriend, as it may be their last time together.\nJust then, Douglas learned her Smart Watch turned red, because ISAC thinks that she's off-mission. Therefore, Douglas was convinced by Schaeffer to leave him to do his mission and go see Faye.\nChickenhawk\nDouglas gives an update to Keener and Schaeffer that Faye Lau has access to President Ellis, as the POTUS liked her enough to be in his security detail. While Keener was glad his plan was working, Schaeffer was wondering who's the next line of succession if Ellis doesn't give clearance to Lau for the key to The Ark, so Douglas confirms that it'll be automaticali given the Secretary of Agriculture, who was working at a CERA base in Arkansas.\nSchaeffer felt apprehensive, knowing that Nat would try to have the Secretary killed so\nCal\ngets the Key. But Douglas tried to assuage his concern, mentioning that Nat would have an easier time pretending to be the hero if she doesn't indiscrimentally kill politicans to install her puppet. One \"suicide\" could be ignored, but seventeen untimely deaths is a pattern that couldn't be explained away.\nUnfortunately for the trio, the Secretary of Agriculture would die of Anaphylaxis due to her allergic reaction to sesame oil. Therefore, the key to The Ark had now passed to Calvin McManus.\nVanguard\nSchaeffer was shocked when he learned that Douglas is best friends with Aaron \"Vanguard\" Keener, with Douglas explaining that they've always been friends and always will be. When asked if she ever hooked up with the rogue agent, Douglas was so grossed out she had to emphasize she's just friends with Keener, nothing more.\nGlasses\nDouglas was with Schaeffer when they talked to ANNA, where Schaaeffer asks the AI what she thinks of Theo Parnell. ANNA answers that she considers \"Glasses\" as the kindest, smartest, and most handsome person who have ever lived, which led to Schaeffer asking if Theo programmed her to say that. ANNA admits that's the case, but her praises for Parnell are mostly true. This led to Douglas asking what's the lie, which ANNA answered that Theo is not the most handsome and considers \"Vanguard\" as the most handsome. Of course, this grossed out Douglas and she asked the AI if he programmed her to say that. ANNA commented that Keener did not know how to program her, but he knows how to make her feel good, which again made Douglas feel gross about it.\nDuring the conversation, Schaeffer noticed vocal similarities between Douglas and the AI, and asks her if she voiced ANNA. Douglas did not, and commented that Claire the one who built her. Schaeffer was confused, which baffled Douglas as she gave him the briefs about Claire, which Schaeffer didn't read on given he was a little busy. Nonetheless, Douglas tells him that Theo didn't build ANNA, he simply set her free.\nClaire Ortiz\nis the one who built ANNA, and if they want this conflict to end, they need Claire.\nAsset\nDouglas discussed with Schaeffer about Natalya Sokolova's asset in Washington D.C, where she expressed her worries that it could be more than one asse. When asked by Schaeffer if her father is one of them, she commented that it's possible given Charles' acquaintance with Sokolova, though she also mentioned that Nat is in many circles within D.C. For all Douglas knows, the asset could be a Kenly College student who took a summer internship at Sokolov Concern, one of Cal's Hunters, or even an actor that Nat hired.\nThe third one amused Schaeffer, remarking it'd be funny if the fate of the free world depended on an actor.\nFish Tacos\nDouglas discuss about\nthe Castle\nwith Schaeffer, where the latter noted her jealousy. She denied it at first, but admitted her jealousy of the work that Lauren Fong and Amanda Weekes were doing in the settlement was making a difference, while all she's doing is clandestine murder sprees. Douglas wasn't amused by Schaeffer's teasing, though she relented when she felt hungry and wanting to eat a fish taco.\nRecruiter\nDouglas discusses about the Hunters with Keener, but more specifically Brian Johnson. She admits that she didn't know him, but she's familiar with him as she often had recruitment dinners with other agents in the program like David, Joe, or Dicky. Keener then mused that his life and Douglas's life were very different back then, even admitting that Douglas wouldn't look at Faye Lau twice, as he likes seeing the couple together, which led Keener to ask if it's horrible he's glad that Amherst blew up the world.\nDouglas admits it's horrible, but knows that Keener is trying to be a good friend to her. However, she soon faces the reality that with Schaeffer in Division's custody and in a coma, they'll be coming for her and Lau next. She was on the verge of tears, where Keener reminded her quality of time spent that matters most. With that in mind, Douglas takes her leave to see Lau one last time.\nNat\nDouglas asked Keener if he ever spent too much time making excuses for someone's behavior that they tend to forget why they're friends with that person to begin with. Keener admits that he never did that as he never lets people very close to him and pushes away anyone who pisses him off. This led to a rant from Douglas about Mackenzie Meret, about how she's never going to change, and will never be satisfied nor happy, and too old to change\nWhile Keener did retort that Mack is 40 years old, Douglas argued that Mack had always been like that since she was 16, it's who she is, and she never has incentive to change. This led to Keener questioning Douglas if she's talking about Natalya Sokolova.\nDouglas calls Nat the saddest person she's ever met, and looking so perfect to others is her superpower. During the talk, she continued her rant, first talking about how it's easily to figure out someone's dream when they say it. But it when comes to Nat, she tends to fulfill a person's deepest desires by scanning a person's face, have the algorithm search every piece on intel on them for hopes and dreams, and it pops up on her smart lens or watch, so she could make anyone's dreams come true.\nKeener couldn't decide if that's amazing or horrifying, where Douglas says it's both. When people have amazing dreams, it can be amazing. But the people who dream of horrible and vile things? That's the world. The world that Douglas and Keener are living in. Sick and twisted, but also glorious and beautiful. Full of possibility and pain.\nWatch\nDouglas shares the titanium bracelet that Mackenzie Meret to Bardon Schaeffer. He was surprised when he read the inappropriate inscription, with Douglas admitting she's the worst. This puzzled Schaeffer, as he knew Mack as a rich philanthropist, which is true. But as Douglas clarified, she's a jerk to her friends, all about ego and competition, and she pins the blame on Natalya Sokolova as these two women always tried to one up each other. Douglas feels that these two women should just have sex and calm down, but that'll never happen as Nat is too repressed and Mack is too much of being herself.\nDouglas clarifies this further, talking about Mack losing her parents at a young age, being shipped to a boarding school and hating her time there, as she didn't want her family's inheritance. Moreover,  Mack didn't want to feed the war machine, which meant never having kids to pass onto the inheritance for as long as she lives.\nShe reveals that Mack launched her fashion line as a joke to throw away the blood money. But in a twist of irony, the fashion line took off, and the blood money multiplied. And Douglas concludes by calling Mack as the sad rich spinster who tried to make up for generations of exploitation, which is never possible, so she spends her time getting drunk and growing tomatoes. And occasion, making titanium bracelets for her friends with inappropriate inscriptions.\nPersonality and Traits\nWIP\nAbilities\nIn-game, Viper was a\nRogue Agent\narmed with a\nBlack Market AK-M\n,\nNavy MP5-N\n,\nBombardier Drones\n,\nOxidizer Chem-Launcher\nand\nConcussion Grenades\n.\nViper Gear\nTrivia\nIn a few audio logs in Season 9, it's revealed that Viper had previously been in a romantic relationship with\nMajor Amanda Xander\nof the\nTrue Sons\n.\nAdditionally, it's also revealed that she was in a relationship with Faye Lau prior to both of their deaths.\nDue to her relationships with Amanda Xander and Faye Lau, it can be indicated that Viper is a lesbian. This is further proven in COMMs from Season 4: End of Watch, where she saw right through advances from Dustin \"Magnus\" Xavier, in addition to remarking that most men in the Black Tusk are not her type and wouldn't let them touch her after Alicia \"Circe\" Coswald told her to get laid.\nAnd to put the pin on that, the \"Meet Cute\" comm from Y6S3: Burden of Truth confirms Viper is a lesbian, as she calls herself a secret member of \"lesbian mafia\" since 1993.\nDespite never being seen using it in-game, she could also be seen holding an\nAUG A3 Para XS\nin her character artwork.\nBounty\nThe Snake Den\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division 2"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Accurate (Weapon Talent) | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "For the Weapon Talent from Tom Clancy's The Division, see\nAccurate (Weapon Talent)\n.\nAccurate\nDetails\nAlways Activated\nAvailable on\nYes\nSpecialized\nMPX\nAccurate\nwas a Weapon\nTalent\nin\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n.\nIt was removed from the game following the release of\nTom Clancy's The Division 2: Warlords of New York\n.\nDescription\n+15% Accuracy\n.\nAvailable on:\nSpecialized\nMPX\n(\nUbisoft Connect\nexclusive)\nPerfectly Accurate\nPerfectly Accurate\nDetails\nAlways Activated\nAvailable on\nYes\nThe Railsplitter\nPerfectly Accurate\nis an enhanced version of\nAccurate\n.\nDescription\n+80% Accuracy\n.\nAvailable on:\nThe Railsplitter\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nWeapon Talents in\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nAccurate\n\u2022\nAllegro\n\u2022\nBehind You\n\u2022\nBoomerang\n\u2022\nBrazen\n\u2022\nBreadbasket\n\u2022\nClose & Personal\n\u2022\nDetermined\n\u2022\nDistance\n\u2022\nExtra\n\u2022\nEyeless\n\u2022\nFast Hands\n\u2022\nFinisher\nFirst Blood\n\u2022\nFlatline\n\u2022\nFrenzy\n\u2022\nFuture Perfect\n\u2022\nHidden Rock\n\u2022\nIgnited\n\u2022\nIn Sync\n\u2022\nJazz Hands\n\u2022\nKiller\n\u2022\nLucky Shot\n\u2022\nMeasured\n\u2022\nNaked\n\u2022\nNear Sighted\n\u2022\nOn Empty\nOptimized\n\u2022\nOptimist\n\u2022\nOutsider\n\u2022\nOverflowing\n\u2022\nOverwhelm\n\u2022\nPerpetuation\n\u2022\nPrecision Strike\n\u2022\nPreservation\n\u2022\nPressure Point\n\u2022\nPrimer Rounds\n\u2022\nPummel\n\u2022\nPumped Up\n\u2022\nRanger\n\u2022\nReformation\nRefreshing\n\u2022\nRifleman\n\u2022\nSadist\n\u2022\nSalvage\n\u2022\nSledgehammer\n\u2022\nSpike\n\u2022\nStabilize\n\u2022\nSteady Handed\n\u2022\nStrained\n\u2022\nSwift\n\u2022\nThunder Strike\n\u2022\nTwinkling Lights\n\u2022\nUnhinged\nUnwavering\n\u2022\nVindictive\nExotic Weapons Talents\nin\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nActum Est\n\u2022\nAdaptive Instincts\n\u2022\nAgonizing Bite\n\u2022\nArdent\n\u2022\nBig Game Hunter\n\u2022\nBinary Trigger\n\u2022\nBreathe Free\n\u2022\nBullet Hell\n\u2022\nBusy Little Bee\n\u2022\nCapacitance\n\u2022\nCapitulate\nDisruptor Rounds\n\u2022\nDoctor Home\n\u2022\nEagle's Strike\n\u2022\nElectromagnetic Accelerator\n\u2022\nFull Stop\n\u2022\nGeri and Freki\n\u2022\nIn Plain Sight\n\u2022\nIncessant Chatter\n\u2022\nLiberty or Death\nMosquito Song\n\u2022\nOrtiz Assault Interface\n\u2022\nPayment in Kind\n\u2022\nPlague of the Outcasts\n\u2022\nRegicide\n\u2022\nRule Them All\n\u2022\nSandman\n\u2022\nSeptic Shock\n\u2022\nSymbiosis\n\u2022\nTenacity\n\u2022\nThe Trap\n\u2022\nUnnerve"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Specializations | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Specializations\nare part of the skill system in\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n.\nUpon reaching the endgame,\nAgents\nunlock access to Specializations:\nSurvivalist\nDemolitionist\nSharpshooter\nGunner\nTechnician\nFirewall\nAgents\ncan switch between unlocked Specializations with no restrictions by talking to the\nQuartermaster\nat the\nBase of Operations\n.

She is currently living in the\nCastle Settlement\nof Washington DC, after the refugee camp(Mandarin Oriental Hotel) she and other orphans are settled in was evacuated due to floods. She and other children are on a scavenging trip for the search of farm seeds, in the process, they were constantly reminded by adults to stay away from\nCapitol Building\n, the Headquarter of the\nTrue Sons\n, and their garrison in the Air & Space Museum. During the trip, Violet and other orphans try to remember what the world used to be and how things changed.\nChapter 2 -Aurelio\nAfter the noon passed, Aurelio witnessed a\ncivilian\nsingle-handedly infiltrated the\nNew York Dark Zone\n. The civilian is wearing Division gear, Aurelio followed her and encountered a group of cultists, he chooses not to engage them out of the morale of Division agents. He stopped in front of a building the civilian went in.\nChapter 3 -April\nThe civilian that Aurelio is following is revealed to be April Kelleher, she sneaked into the Dark Zone to explore the answer to the death of her husband. In contrast to Aurelio's encounter with the cultists, she bypassed the church and entered a building, where she found a copy of\nNew York Collapse\n, and the author himself, Warren Merchant, real name is Roger Koopman, she believes he has the answer that she is seeking.\nChapter 4 -Violet\nViolet and her group collected resources for food productions. However, during their voyage home, they nearly stepped into a\nDark Zone South\n, covered with\nDC-62\n. Fortunately, they were stopped by a Division agent who witnessed them working in the wrong direction. Ewan asked the Division agent about the whereabouts of his father, Aurelio Diaz, who is also a Division agent. The Division Agent only heard from him a couple of while ago, he later departs to an unknown location. Violet and her group traveled back to the Castle Settlement, Violet realized that their situation is going to be more and more dangerous as time went on.\nChapter 5 -April\nApril finally found the man she was looking for, the author of\nNew York Collapse\n, Warren Merchant, real name Roger Koopman. April learned Amherst's plan and motive behind releasing the Green Poison and learned the existence of\nBroad-Spectrum Antiviral\n. Koopman knew those information a long time ago, but he is in fear of being pursued by organizations that presumably have the same agenda as Amherst or organizations that wish to use the Dollar Flu for their own benefits, and went into hiding. His last information to April's answer is located in Michigan, Ann Arbor. April stayed for the night in Koopman's hideout, the latter agreed to find a way to send her off Manhattan.\nChapter 6 -Aurelio\nAurelio waited in front of Koopman's hideout and yielded no result, he was later forced to leave after hearing a distant gunshot erupted somewhere in the North of the Darkzone. Although no JTF or Division agent was involved in the fighting, Aurelio headed towards the direction of the gunshot to investigate. Aurelio arrived at the source of the gunshot, only witnessed the aftermath of two groups of Rioters attacked each other, he was then ambushed from behind from a surviving Rioter, Aurelio shoots him dead in response. Although not injured, his comlink break from the ambush, Aurelio returned to a JTF safehouse before resting for the night.\nChapter 7 -Violet\nMike Snow\n, the leader of the Castle Settlement and a former True Son sergeant, discussed their situation and the threat of the true son to the settlements, Violet and other children listened aside.\nChapter 8 -Aurelio\nAurelio woke up on day 2 and briefed of the current situation of Manhattan. He later asked Ed Duran for information regarding Roger Koopman and his connection to the JTF, yielded little result. Ed tasked Aurelio to deliver a mission report to\nJTF's main base of operation\nafter the previous Division Agent Lillian was killed before she could deliver it. Aurelio passed a field market, and stopped for buying bread, in which the baker give it for free to a Division Agent. He arrived at the base of operation and delivered the intel to the JTF officer in charge, Lieutenant Hendricks.\nChapter 9 -April\nApril woke up around morning and accepted the hospitality given by Koopman, such as enjoying a nice cup of coffee. April thanked Koopman for giving all the knowledge she needs to survive and the clues he has given in the book that leads April one step closer to finding out the truth behind her husband's death. Koopman gave April a letter to be delivered to Riverside Temple Club, and they would get her off Manhattan. After exiting the dark zone, April eventually located the Temple Club and met the leader of the Club, the latter promised her to get her off the island only after 10 PM.\nChapter 10 -Aurelio\nAurelio tracked a group of smugglers performing \"Latrans\" service, to smuggle refugees off Manhattan to New Jersey and the western zone, but in reality, they seized their resources and murder them in the end, a JTF assault squad located this group of smugglers, but encountered heavy resistance, and called backup. Aurelio reinforced the squad by eliminating the majority of smugglers. After the event, Aurelio wishes to return to Washington DC to secure the capital and at the meantime to check on his children, he informed Lieutenant Hendricks of his decision, the latter replied that the JTF is mobilizing all resources to retake the city hall and Brooklyn Bridge, requesting Aurelio to stay for another three days. Aurelio agreed, not before he requested Hendricks to search for any information regarding the status of his children back at Washington DC.\nChapter 11 -Violet\nSituations in Washington DC escalated. Yesterday night, two factions fought each other in museums surrounding the national square. The conflict only stopped due to the poor visibility caused by the rain. The residents inside the Castle Settlement realized that their situation is getting desperate.\nChapter 12 -April\nAt 10 PM, April accompanied by Michael left the Temple Club and proceeded to exit Manhattan. April eventually makes it out of Manhattan and landed in Brooklyn, where she proceeded to find Blake, departing towards the voyage of Michigan.\nChapter 13 -Violet\nAfter yesterday's raining stopped, Violet and other orphans, Mike and Jennie proceed to collect plants for the plantation back at Campus Settlement.

The barge is run by Sonia, her wife Julia, and their twin sons Tim and Jake. Their progress is slow, especially when then have to move through a lock. There is a small, non-violent, but tense, encounter with some cultists of a sort who make a trade for some mules.\nChapter 20 - Violet\nThe\nCastle Settlement\nis on high alert after the attack at the pond. The children make the best of it by playing outside. Violet goes inside and overhears the adults talking about their concerns over food. At this point, it is confirmed that the Castle Settlement contains roughly 100 survivors. Violet returns to the other kids and they talk about the places they've been and the concern that they won't get to go further.\nChapter 21 - Aurelio\nAurelio arrives in Harrisburg and is assigned a room in a makeshift barracks by the local JTF. As he relaxes, he goes over what he's learned and his thoughts on Ike\nChapter 22 - Ike\nIke has made it to Stroudsburg thanks to the JTF Convoy. Once there, he debates over whether he should help the local JTF with a mission and eventually decides to help. This is mainly because of the unwanted attention it would bring him if he didn't. His assignment is to stop a group of terrorists planning to blow up a bridge. Ike makes his way to their campsite and takes them out, accidentally killing a woman with shrapnel and takes her baby back to the JTF encampment. This chapter confirms that Ike has technology with him that will stop ISAC from marking him as a Rogue Agent.\nChapter 23 - Violet\nViolet, along with Saeed and Amelia, decide to roam around outside the Castle seeing how far they can go before the adults will bring them back. They are walking when they witness when Air Force One gets attacked and falls out of the sky. They talk about it as they wander around and they end up by the Mall. As they are playing on a nearby carousel, members of the True Sons walk up and talk to the kids, getting information on the leaders of the Castle. At this point in time, Violet and the kids don't know that the men are part of the True Sons and they lead them back to the settlement. The True Sons soldiers talk with Junie as the chapter ends\nChapter 24 - Aurelio\nChapter 25 - Ike"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Alvaro's Message | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Alvaro's Message\nDescription\nAnswering machine message from Alvaro to Kim.\nAudio\nhttps://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/File:Alvaro%27s_Message.ogg\nType\nPhone Recordings\nSeries\nWeek Two\nLocation\nChelsea\n(492, 903)\nNext\nRadio Show Rant\nKIM:\nCan\u2019t take your call, but you know what to do.\nALVARO:\nHey Kim... um, this is Alvaro.

Dark Zones | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "For the Dark Zone in Tom Clancy's The Division, see\nN.Y.C. Dark Zone\n.\n\u201c\nThe Dark Zone is a place for wolves and not sheep.\n- Description\n\u201d\nThe\nDecontamination Zones of the District of Columbia\n, colloquially known as the\nDark Zones of D.C.\n, are\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n's\nversion of the open Player Versus Player (PVP) zones with some Player Versus Environment (PVE) elements tied-in.\nThe Dark Zone is an untamed area of the map where any agents can go off the grid to do terrible things. The Dark Zone is also the most dangerous area in the game, where fear, betrayal, and tensions are high, as any other agent can turn against you and steal your hard-earned loot.\nThe Dark Zone is per design an area that provides many challenges. The NPCs you meet are brutal \u2013 but the biggest challenge has always been the other players. While the DZ used to have a lot of features to make the DZ more PVE player-friendly, with\nTitle Update 8\nmany of these changes were reversed and the Dark Zone became more focused on PVP.\nContents\n1\nDark Zone Story\n2\nGameplay\n2.1\nNormalization\n2.2\nGoing Rogue\n2.3\nDark Zone Checkpoints\n2.4\nInvaded Dark Zones\n2.5\nLandmarks\n2.6\nExtractions\n2.7\nSafe Rooms\n3\nDark Zone Rank\n4\nDZ Supply Drops\n5\nDark Zones Areas\n5.1\nDark Zone East\n5.2\nDark Zone South\n5.3\nDark Zone West\n6\nDark Zone Vendors\n7\nGallery\n8\nTrivia\n9\nAppearances\nDark Zone Story\nConsequences of DC-62\nIn the early days of the\noutbreak\n, the government attempted to eradicate the\nvirus\n. When these attempts failed, they walled off the most contaminated areas to try to quarantine them. In these newly established Dark Zones, an experimental chemical was deployed to try to help. This chemical (named\nDC-62\n) was a massive failure, ending up being just as lethal as the virus. This left large areas of the Capital uninhabitable and caused many looters and factions to not risk entry. That meant that high-tier weapons and gear were left behind and are now up for grabs by anyone who is willing to enter. Unfortunately, some of this gear is contaminated and must be extracted to be cleaned before it can be used. Any agent who is nearby and has questionable loyalties may decide that they'd rather have the loot for themselves and go rogue in an attempt to claim it.\nGameplay\nThe Dark Zone is the only location in which players can roam solo or in a group in an openly PVP environment without limits. In the Dark Zone, players will be able to do challenges, landmarks, take down enemy faction bosses for loot. Similar to\nTom Clancy's The Division\n,\nplayers will need to extract the contaminated loot before it can be used in the open world.\nNormalization\nIn the Division 2, the three Dark Zones in Washington D.C. utilize \"normalization\" to level the player field. Normalization reduces the peaks and valleys between players who have high survivability or high damage output. Normalization only affects Base Amor and Weapon Damage. AI are not exempt from normalization either; they adhere to the same normalization rules players do.\nMatchmaking in the Dark Zones occurs in two separate brackets. On the one side, players are matched in level buckets (1-10, 11-20, and 21-30) and normalized to the same power level. On the other side, all players who have reached World Tier are matched together and normalized to the same World Tier. For players above the normalized power level, bonus statistics are applied to reward you for your time.\nGoing Rogue\nPlayers can choose to go\nRogue\nto engage in PvP activities with other players.\nDark Zone Checkpoints\nDark Zone Checkpoint\nDark Zones now have DZ Checkpoints that are armed with automated turrets that guard the entrance of every Dark Zone, and they protect newcomers from\nRogue\nagents or enemies.\nInvaded Dark Zones\nBlack Tusk faction\nOnce players reach\nWorld Tier 1\n, Dark Zones will start becoming Invaded. The dangerous end-game faction\nBlack Tusk\nwill periodically move in one of the three Dark Zones and give you a challenge.\nLandmarks\nAs you explore the Dark Zone you will find\nLandmarks\n. These Landmarks can be special streets, stores, or just random abandoned buildings. These\nLandmarks\nare spots where you find strong elite opponents and also named enemies that guarantee good loot-drops for one and usually guard one of the Dark Zone Chests.\nLandmarks\nevolved over time. First, you just needed to clear them and later they got multiple waves. The\nLandmarks\nalso provide different challenges: Normal and Hard difficulty.\nWhen someone clears a\nLandmark\n, you can see it on the map and you also get a timer indicating how long ago it was cleared. This way you know that a player should be in the area.\nExtractions\nRogue Agent prepares the ambush\nThe only way to permanently keep contaminated loot and Dark Zone resources from the Dark Zone is to go through the extraction process. Each Dark Zone has three areas where you can call an extraction. Any player or group member can call the extraction but only one group can call an extraction in such an area. If an extraction is called, a clear visible flair is fired and the players and NPCs in the area will be alerted to the extraction. You will have a clear countdown of how long it takes for the helicopter to arrive.\nWhen the chopper has arrived, another timer will start and every member of the group can attach the contaminated loot to the rope that is dropped. Other players/groups may also attach their loot to the cable and fill up the remaining loot slots (there are 4 slots).\nOnce the timer is over, the helicopter takes the contaminated loot away. After that, you can pick up the decontaminated items from any Stash.\nThis extraction process is for loot only; the player will remain in the Dark Zone and can continue their search for loot.\nIt's important to note that, until the helicopter has left, other players can cut the rope and drop all the loot that is attached to it, allowing anyone to pick it up again and steal it. So it recommended to remain at the extraction and wait until the chopper has left - because only then is your loot safe.\nCutting the rope will turn you\nRogue\n, so expect players to protect their loot when this happens.\nSafe Rooms\nInside each Dark Zone, you can find a\nSafe Room\n. This Safe Room is personal to your group and can\u00b4t be entered by other players. This Safe Room has multiple exits that allow you to leave the place from a different exit. The Safe Room is easily recognizable thanks to the big circular marker on the wall. Once you enter the Safe Room, your ammo will be restocked as well.\nDark Zone Rank\nPlayer progression is split between Player Level and Dark Zone Rank. While the Player Level defines your progression as a character, your health pool, and what weapon and items you can equip, the Dark Zone Rank is more like a rank system.\nDark Zone XP is earned via Supply Drops, completing or hijacking extractions, revives, killing\nRogues\nor agents, or going\nManhunt\n. Basically some form of interaction with other players. Dying will cause you to lose some Dark Zone XP and potentially rank down. Currently, the maximum Dark Zone Rank is 50.\nThe Dark Zone Rank is also tied to the\nDark Zone Perks\nthat can be unlocked at the\nBase of Operations\n. One Perk becomes available every 5 DZ Ranks and if you drop down in rank, those perks may become deactivated again.\nDZ Supply Drops\nThis is a returning activity from\nTom Clancy's The Division\n. In regular intervals, you get a Dark Zone Supply Drop that will land somewhere in the Dark Zone. It will be guarded by strong NPCs and once you have cleared the area \u2013 you also need to claim the Supply Drop. When you claim it, you get the reward for the group or you can steal it for yourself and go\nRogue\nin the process. Those Supply Drops will be broadcasted over the map, so all players will know if the Supply Drop is being or was claimed.\nSupply Drops can happen in\nLandmarks\nthat are not active and the fights for these can feature multiple bosses or factions. This will not only raise the difficulty, but it will bring more variety into the game loop and makes the drops less predictable. Also, more bosses and factions mean a higher chance or contaminated loot, so fighting for these drops will be more lucrative.\nDark Zones Areas\nEvery Dark Zone has their own distinct environment, landmarks, and challenges. There are different challenges every time the player plays in the Dark Zone.\nDark Zone East\nLocated near the East Mall, Dark Zone East was a military-occupied area. An explosion at a containment storage containing\nDC-62\nled to massive casualties, forcing whatever was left of the\nJTF\nand the volunteers to evacuate the area and lead to the area being walled off. The wall off attempt was successful.\nDark Zone South\nLocated in Waterfront, Dark Zone South was the primary storage facility site for DC-62, as well as the back-up military base after DZ East was evacuated. A flood breached the vaults containing DC-62 and spilled it across the whole zone. The military and scientists within the zone were once again forced to evacuate and wall off the whole zone.\nDark Zone West\nLocated in Georgetown, the town willfully allowed the government to come in and fumigate the town with DC-62, long before the lethal effects were fully known. The area was walled off shortly after the first few deaths of the toxin happened, and is now a \"ghost town\".\nDark Zone Vendors\nDark Zone Vendor\nOutside of each Dark Zone's entrance is a\nDark Zone Vendor\nwho offers a rotating selection of items for sale, including at least one Dark Zone-exclusive item (barring\nRaid\n-exclusive\nExotic\nitems); however, they will only accept payment in\nDZ Resources\n.\nDZ Resources\ncan be obtained by deconstructing Contaminated items (requires extraction) or looting specific crates inside the Dark Zones (no extraction required).\nEach of the three Dark Zone Vendors have separate inventories. They will also buy items like other vendors, but only pay in\nE-Credits.\nGallery\nConcept art of a Non-Rogue Division agent and a Rogue Division agent exchanging gunfire between each other\nTwo Division agents entering a Dark Zone Checkpoint\nA Division agent extracting an item in the extraction zone by helicopter\nConcept art of a Division agent requesting for extraction whilst being protected by other two Division agents\nConcept art of Division agents standing around the entrance to Dark Zone South\nA Division agent in Dark Zone East getting ready to ambush a couple of enemies\nDivision agents in the Dark Zone in a deadlock situation with other Division agents\nTrivia\nPrior to\nTitle Update 8\n, Invaded Dark Zones were named Occupied Dark Zones, where gear normalization was deactivated. The update applied normalization to Invaded Dark Zones as well, meaning the only remaining difference in Invaded Dark Zones is the presence of Black Tusk.\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division 2"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Title Update 6.1 | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Title Update 6.1\nis an update that was released for\nTom Clancy's\u00a0The Division 2\non December 9, 2019.\nContents\n1\nSituation: Snowball\n2\nApparel Event #5 \u2013 Silent Night\n3\nHardcore Mode Beta\n4\nGameplay Changes\n5\nBug fixes\nSituation: Snowball\nThe holiday season is upon us and with that, we have presents and activities!

In the Hazmat Kit, it appears in a white camouflage with an orange \"hex-pattern\" decal overlaid on the white. In addition, medical tape is wrapped around the grip and the magazine of the weapon.\nIn the National Guard Kit, the weapon appears with a unique digital camo paint scheme. With the Paramedic Kit, the weapon is mostly in a custom light gray scheme with a black magazine. On the magazine is blue medical tape at the bottom with 'EM1' written on it.\nCompared to other assault rifles, the P416 is a fairly well-balanced weapon with a high rate of fire and decent damage per shot.\nThe \"Custom\" variant is used by\nrogue first-wave agents\nand LMB Assault , while the \"Military\" variant is used by LMB Scouts, LMB Grenadiers and LMB Engineers\nVariants\nMilitary P416\nCustom P416 G3\nEMT P416\nHazmat P416\nJTF P416\nTrivia\nThe P416 has appeared in several other Tom Clancy and Ubisoft games.

She grew up on a secluded estate in the Scottish Highlands. After attending university, Douglas completed an eight-year stint in the\nSpecial Air Service\nbefore taking a position in D&H as a logistics and supply specialist. When\nGreen Poison\nhit, she was immediately recruited by\nBlack Tusk\n, and despite her father's objections she joined Black Tusk.\nHistory\nPrior to Tom Clancy's The Division 2\nBridgette grew as typical of children of rich and powerful folks, living in the shadow of her father's company. Due to her upbringing, she was expected to act as the perfect daughter in the higher echelon of society throughout, giving her father and his company many contracts. During her upbringing, she struck a friendship with\nMackenzie Meret\nand\nNatalya Sokolova\n.\nHer act got the attention of\nCalvin McManus\n, who gave her a smart watch and was given basic SHD training. She was also selected to be part of the Hunter program. When the Green Poison outbreak hit the country, she wasn't activated as a Division agent, leading her to be immediately recruited by Black Tusk. Not long after her recruitment, Bridge attempted to convince Mackenzie to join Black Tusk. However, Mack wanted nothing to do with Black Tusk nor with Natalya Sokolova. The fact that Douglas was also in allegiance with the PMC soured her friendship with Mack.\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nHowever, she'd have second guesses about her allegiance with Black Tusk, presumably due to learning about  Sokolova's true intentions. Wanting to set things right, she found herself in contact with Aaron Keener. During the events of Division 2's base story, she fed him intel about her father's whereabouts as well as intel on President Ellis. It was her intel about Ellis's residence in Camp White Oak that had \"Luna\" leak intel about the president's whereabouts to the Division, allowing Keener and his rogues time to work on deploying the Rogue network.\nWarlords of New York\nDuring the events of Warlords of New York, Douglas was coerced by Keener to act as the honeypot to Faye Lau, convincing the latter to join Black Tusk so they could undermine the organization and the Hunters. It took some time, but Lau managed to infiltrate Black Tusk. Throughout the course of WONY's campaign, she questioned Keener about letting his lieutenants die, though she'd be surprised when she learns that Theo Parnell is alive thanks to deceiving ISAC with a decoy and a copy of ANNA, tricking the Division into believing he's dead.\nAfter Warlords of New York\nAfter the events of WONY, Douglas still corresponded with Keener, revealing that due to Mackenzie's refusal in joining Black Tusk, she basically signed her death warrant. The two discussed about Mack with Keener having romantic admiration for her, prompting Douglas to call him a lovesick puppy. She remarked that if he and Mack got together, Sokolova would try to get rid of him since he's not the first suitor for Mack, calling Nat a Hydra who's each head is happy to get rid of the competition.\nAt some point, Douglas reached out to Major Amanda Xander, her ex-girlfriend, to try and talk things with Faye Lau. Xander wanted nothing to do with Lau as she held a grudge against the agent, even informing General Anderson about Black Tusk's involvement, warning Natalya Sokolova to not interfere further after he cut ties with the organization.\nDouglas also shared intel to Keener on Sokolova's control of the manufacturing process, which she has complete control \"in all the ways that matters\". She felt a bit uncomfortable over Keener's change of heart, in which he retorted that they all have to evolve if they want to survive. Douglas admitted that she was actively trying to be away from Nat's leash, and Keener tried to convince her to stop \"wearing the Black Tusk girdle\". However, Douglas preferred to stay as \"Operation Cassandra\" depended on her staying in Nat's good graces.\nEnd of Watch\nLater on, she got put in a team with Faye Lau, where she'd work in logistics for Lau's operation. The two struck a relationship, though it's unknown if Douglas told her she's part of the Hunter program. Regardless, when Lau and her lieutenants got on the Division's radar, agents would hunt Douglas down in Southwest of Washington, D.C. and end her.\nFirst Rogue\nThroughout various comms collected during the trials set by Aaron Keener, the agents learn more about Bridgette Douglas and her partnership with Keener. The comms first delves into her father, Charles Douglas, and her love-hate relationship she has for him given how she felt mistreated by him when he groomed her to be the perfect daughter to squeeze rich people for his business, and her father's position in the White House.\nThen it later delves into other topics, starting Douglas sharing President Ellis' location at Camp White Oak to Keener, allowing him to share it to\n\"Luna\"\nto buy time in deploying the Rogue Network nationally. Later comms delve into Douglas informing Keener that Mackenzie Meret \"signing\" her \"death warrant\" for refusing to join Natalya Sokolova's Black Tusk, and teasing him for his crush on the former socialite, then sharing what she knows about Nat's control over the manufacturing process in her organization while actively trying to look for ways to get herself out of the CEO's leash.\nAll in all, the comms revealed Douglas changing sides as she wanted nothing to do with Black Tusk and partnering with Keener to help him out in his mission to stop Black Tusk and the Hunters.\nShades of Red\nWhile she wasn't heard in the comms intercepted by SHD Agents during their trail to find\n\"Glasses\"\n, Bridgette Douglas was heard in various comms intercepted during their incursions in the Descent simulation facility, where she was first heard giving reports to Natalya Sokolova about the state of things in Coney Island, Lower Manhattan, and Brooklyn as part of her \"recon mission\".\nBut for the most part, the comms involved Douglas talking with Aaron Keener about recruiting people for his settlement. A number of them happened to be members from the Castle Settlement the Division agents rescued while they were under Black Tusk's custody. Though there two people that weren't members of the Castle, Maral McCarthy and Rodney Bishop. Douglas was apprehensive about having Maral as the social director of Keener's settlement, given she's pregnant with Theo's child and claiming the settlement is ground zero, which turned into a discussion that the former friendship Keener had with Calvin McManus.\nThen came Rodney Bishop, who was hired by Keener to be in charge of the supplies, which Douglas had misgivings as she thinks Bishop is a fanboy who's in love with the idea of who Keener is. Though, she does admit that having someone like Bishop spreading the gospel of his hero helps things for the settlement.\nAfter the Division rescued Parnell for extraction at the NOA HQ and dealing with the Hyenas, they recovered 4 comms during the assault. One comm, in particular, involved Parnell reviewing the Hunter roster which confirmed that Bridgette Douglas is indeed a Hunter. This comm took place few months ago, as Douglas was Keener's ace in the hole to help Faye Lau infilitrate Black Tusk. While Parnell was apprehensive at first, he was convinced when Keener vouched for Douglas, remarking that she kept him out of trouble a number of times.\nInterestingly enough, when discussing about Birdie Malik with Keener, Douglas mentioned that Birdie alongside her adopted brother Vikram were sent to the Castle Settlement which happened during the events of\nPuppeteers\n. This implies that Douglas survived her encounter with the Division agents in Washington, D.C. using the hologram technology that Keener and Parnell procured from the Descent simulation program. If so, her current whereabouts are unknown.\nBurden of Truth\nDuring the Division's latest incursion to the Descent simulation facility, Bridgette Douglas was heard in a comm between her and Keener, where she confirmed that Bardon Schaeffer was alive and sent to the White House after his tussle against the agents in Coney Island. However, because Schaeffer was in a coma due to the injuries he sustained, he couldn't deliver Faye Lau's message in the White House, and Douglas expressed that\nshe was set to be next in the Division's hit-list.\nAdditionally, Douglas would be heard again through the intel the agents are recovering during their trail to find Agent Kelso in D.C, as she had a role in the whole mess with Lau, the Cassandra mission, and Bardon Schaeffer.\nHoney Pot\nAfter following the first intel in East Mall, Division agents intercepted a comm between Aaron Keener and Douglas, after the latter met with Faye Lau. Douglas was hesitant to share the truth, but Keener encouraged her to be honest as no relationship based on lies ever survives. This changed to a personal conversation about Keener's envy of the human connection he saw in the Morretis, Theo and Maral, and his crush on Mackenzie Meret. Of course, Douglas seemed to prefer sarcastic megalomaniac Keener over the emotionally mature Keener.\nMeet Cute\nAfter they followed the second intel in Southwest, Division agents intercepted a comm between Douglas and Keener, where she shared a bit of her conversation with Faye Lau during their meeting to Keener. Keene admitted that Lau didn't expect Douglas having attraction to women, which she proudly admitted though mentioned that wasn't good for her father's business, which Keener disliked about. She then asked Keener of his opinion towards Lau, where he believes she's dangerous for her, though Douglas retorted she wouldn't betray them. Keener agreed, but recommended Douglas to not sleep with Lau. Douglas argues that'd blow her cover, and commented that being in the Black Tusk is like living in the Olympic Village, where beautiful people in peak condition often sleep together because they don't have anything to do between fights.\nKeener conceded to his friend's point, telling her to do what she to do, but stay focused nonetheless.\nThe Mission\nWhen Division agents followed the third intel, they intercept a comm that involved a discussion between Douglas and Keener, where the former admits that she'd understand and wouldn't be disappointed if Lau refused to take the mission to kill President Ellis. Keener argues that's less extreme than what she's already done. Douglas, on the other hand, argues that it'll involve a lot of roleplaying and an uncomfortable outfit. Moreover, Lau will have to talk to Ellis, be respectful to him, and make him feel like the most important person in the world, which Keener admits was a challenge as Ellis was an idiot, which Douglas also agreed upon.\nStill, given that Ellis was the only who had access to \"The Ark Protocol\" and was yet to resign or name his successor, that emphasized the importance of Lau's mission. Though, Douglas preferred calling it \"the football\" as she finds the clandestine naming stuff hard to follow and kind of annoying.\nGreen Light\nWhen agents of the Division followed the fourth intel, they interceped a comm where Douglas confirms to Keener that Faye Lau is committed in her mission, playing the politics. And if necessary, kill President Ellis, especially she refused to call him POTUS. In addition, she'll go through\nNatalya Sokolova'\ns tests for the rebuilt BTSU, test her skills as a leader and antagonise the hell out of\nBardon Schaeffer\nfor Nat's pleasure.\nKeener was confused at the last part, since he thought Schaeffer was Nat's most loyal soldier. However, Douglas mentions that Schaeffer got kicked from Ellis' security detail, and Nat had to solve a problem that he created. And in Nat's mind, that made Schaeffer her sworn enemy.\nDouglas would go further in exemplifying Nat's flaws. She doesn't tolerate being questioned or breaking her system. Efficiency at all costs. Acceptable loss is personnel. And as far as Natalya is concerned, her systems are infallible and cannot be questioned.\nKeener commented that Douglas makes Nat sound like a psychopath, and Douglas wondered if Nat is a narcissist or undiagnosed autistic, but doesn't really know. Whatever the case, Douglas vented further about Nat, mentioning that she never admits she's ever done anything wrong, which was more exemplified when no one told Nat no during her childhood, which turned her into a privileged asshole as an adult. Lastly, Douglas mentions Natalya as a prime example of a privileged asshole who's given unlimited resources and a private army, which sets the picture for the current situation that Douglas and Keener were dealing with.\nRed Light\nPrior to\nSchaeffer going to Coney Island to act as bait for the Division\n, Douglas tried to convince him not to go through with it. Schaeffer is still all in on this, believing it can't be for nothing and mentioned that she's the one who got him into this. Douglas was frustrated about this predicament, and expressed that it's not fair, considering that she, Schaeffer, and Lau are gonna be meeting death. Schaeffer argued that it's the quality of time that matters, and encouraged her to spend as much time as possible with her girlfriend, as it may be their last time together.\nJust then, Douglas learned her Smart Watch turned red, because ISAC thinks that she's off-mission. Therefore, Douglas was convinced by Schaeffer to leave him to do his mission and go see Faye.\nChickenhawk\nDouglas gives an update to Keener and Schaeffer that Faye Lau has access to President Ellis, as the POTUS liked her enough to be in his security detail. While Keener was glad his plan was working, Schaeffer was wondering who's the next line of succession if Ellis doesn't give clearance to Lau for the key to The Ark, so Douglas confirms that it'll be automaticali given the Secretary of Agriculture, who was working at a CERA base in Arkansas.\nSchaeffer felt apprehensive, knowing that Nat would try to have the Secretary killed so\nCal\ngets the Key. But Douglas tried to assuage his concern, mentioning that Nat would have an easier time pretending to be the hero if she doesn't indiscrimentally kill politicans to install her puppet. One \"suicide\" could be ignored, but seventeen untimely deaths is a pattern that couldn't be explained away.\nUnfortunately for the trio, the Secretary of Agriculture would die of Anaphylaxis due to her allergic reaction to sesame oil. Therefore, the key to The Ark had now passed to Calvin McManus.\nVanguard\nSchaeffer was shocked when he learned that Douglas is best friends with Aaron \"Vanguard\" Keener, with Douglas explaining that they've always been friends and always will be. When asked if she ever hooked up with the rogue agent, Douglas was so grossed out she had to emphasize she's just friends with Keener, nothing more.\nGlasses\nDouglas was with Schaeffer when they talked to ANNA, where Schaaeffer asks the AI what she thinks of Theo Parnell. ANNA answers that she considers \"Glasses\" as the kindest, smartest, and most handsome person who have ever lived, which led to Schaeffer asking if Theo programmed her to say that. ANNA admits that's the case, but her praises for Parnell are mostly true. This led to Douglas asking what's the lie, which ANNA answered that Theo is not the most handsome and considers \"Vanguard\" as the most handsome. Of course, this grossed out Douglas and she asked the AI if he programmed her to say that. ANNA commented that Keener did not know how to program her, but he knows how to make her feel good, which again made Douglas feel gross about it.\nDuring the conversation, Schaeffer noticed vocal similarities between Douglas and the AI, and asks her if she voiced ANNA. Douglas did not, and commented that Claire the one who built her. Schaeffer was confused, which baffled Douglas as she gave him the briefs about Claire, which Schaeffer didn't read on given he was a little busy. Nonetheless, Douglas tells him that Theo didn't build ANNA, he simply set her free.\nClaire Ortiz\nis the one who built ANNA, and if they want this conflict to end, they need Claire.\nAsset\nDouglas discussed with Schaeffer about Natalya Sokolova's asset in Washington D.C, where she expressed her worries that it could be more than one asse. When asked by Schaeffer if her father is one of them, she commented that it's possible given Charles' acquaintance with Sokolova, though she also mentioned that Nat is in many circles within D.C. For all Douglas knows, the asset could be a Kenly College student who took a summer internship at Sokolov Concern, one of Cal's Hunters, or even an actor that Nat hired.\nThe third one amused Schaeffer, remarking it'd be funny if the fate of the free world depended on an actor.\nFish Tacos\nDouglas discuss about\nthe Castle\nwith Schaeffer, where the latter noted her jealousy. She denied it at first, but admitted her jealousy of the work that Lauren Fong and Amanda Weekes were doing in the settlement was making a difference, while all she's doing is clandestine murder sprees. Douglas wasn't amused by Schaeffer's teasing, though she relented when she felt hungry and wanting to eat a fish taco.\nRecruiter\nDouglas discusses about the Hunters with Keener, but more specifically Brian Johnson. She admits that she didn't know him, but she's familiar with him as she often had recruitment dinners with other agents in the program like David, Joe, or Dicky. Keener then mused that his life and Douglas's life were very different back then, even admitting that Douglas wouldn't look at Faye Lau twice, as he likes seeing the couple together, which led Keener to ask if it's horrible he's glad that Amherst blew up the world.\nDouglas admits it's horrible, but knows that Keener is trying to be a good friend to her. However, she soon faces the reality that with Schaeffer in Division's custody and in a coma, they'll be coming for her and Lau next. She was on the verge of tears, where Keener reminded her quality of time spent that matters most. With that in mind, Douglas takes her leave to see Lau one last time.\nNat\nDouglas asked Keener if he ever spent too much time making excuses for someone's behavior that they tend to forget why they're friends with that person to begin with. Keener admits that he never did that as he never lets people very close to him and pushes away anyone who pisses him off. This led to a rant from Douglas about Mackenzie Meret, about how she's never going to change, and will never be satisfied nor happy, and too old to change\nWhile Keener did retort that Mack is 40 years old, Douglas argued that Mack had always been like that since she was 16, it's who she is, and she never has incentive to change. This led to Keener questioning Douglas if she's talking about Natalya Sokolova.\nDouglas calls Nat the saddest person she's ever met, and looking so perfect to others is her superpower. During the talk, she continued her rant, first talking about how it's easily to figure out someone's dream when they say it. But it when comes to Nat, she tends to fulfill a person's deepest desires by scanning a person's face, have the algorithm search every piece on intel on them for hopes and dreams, and it pops up on her smart lens or watch, so she could make anyone's dreams come true.\nKeener couldn't decide if that's amazing or horrifying, where Douglas says it's both. When people have amazing dreams, it can be amazing. But the people who dream of horrible and vile things? That's the world. The world that Douglas and Keener are living in. Sick and twisted, but also glorious and beautiful. Full of possibility and pain.\nWatch\nDouglas shares the titanium bracelet that Mackenzie Meret to Bardon Schaeffer. He was surprised when he read the inappropriate inscription, with Douglas admitting she's the worst. This puzzled Schaeffer, as he knew Mack as a rich philanthropist, which is true. But as Douglas clarified, she's a jerk to her friends, all about ego and competition, and she pins the blame on Natalya Sokolova as these two women always tried to one up each other. Douglas feels that these two women should just have sex and calm down, but that'll never happen as Nat is too repressed and Mack is too much of being herself.\nDouglas clarifies this further, talking about Mack losing her parents at a young age, being shipped to a boarding school and hating her time there, as she didn't want her family's inheritance. Moreover,  Mack didn't want to feed the war machine, which meant never having kids to pass onto the inheritance for as long as she lives.\nShe reveals that Mack launched her fashion line as a joke to throw away the blood money. But in a twist of irony, the fashion line took off, and the blood money multiplied. And Douglas concludes by calling Mack as the sad rich spinster who tried to make up for generations of exploitation, which is never possible, so she spends her time getting drunk and growing tomatoes. And occasion, making titanium bracelets for her friends with inappropriate inscriptions.\nPersonality and Traits\nWIP\nAbilities\nIn-game, Viper was a\nRogue Agent\narmed with a\nBlack Market AK-M\n,\nNavy MP5-N\n,\nBombardier Drones\n,\nOxidizer Chem-Launcher\nand\nConcussion Grenades\n.\nViper Gear\nTrivia\nIn a few audio logs in Season 9, it's revealed that Viper had previously been in a romantic relationship with\nMajor Amanda Xander\nof the\nTrue Sons\n.\nAdditionally, it's also revealed that she was in a relationship with Faye Lau prior to both of their deaths.\nDue to her relationships with Amanda Xander and Faye Lau, it can be indicated that Viper is a lesbian. This is further proven in COMMs from Season 4: End of Watch, where she saw right through advances from Dustin \"Magnus\" Xavier, in addition to remarking that most men in the Black Tusk are not her type and wouldn't let them touch her after Alicia \"Circe\" Coswald told her to get laid.\nAnd to put the pin on that, the \"Meet Cute\" comm from Y6S3: Burden of Truth confirms Viper is a lesbian, as she calls herself a secret member of \"lesbian mafia\" since 1993.\nDespite never being seen using it in-game, she could also be seen holding an\nAUG A3 Para XS\nin her character artwork.\nBounty\nThe Snake Den\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division 2"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Talk:Natalya Sokolova | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "There is currently no text in this page.\nYou can\nsearch for this page title\nin other pages, or\nsearch the related logs\n, but you do not have permission to create this page."}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Flatiron District | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Flatiron District\nInformation\nLevel\n15 - 16\nThe\nFlatiron District\nof\nManhattan\nstands as a haunting shadow of it's former vibrancy. Once a bustling hub of innovation, culture, and commerce, this historic neighborhood - centered around the iconic Flatiron Building at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Broadway - has been transformed into a desolate battleground following the\nGreen Poison\noutbreak, a deadly engineered virus that decimated\nNew York City\n.\nSafe House\n: Madison's Stand\nRespawn Point\nSocial Area\n1x Gear Vendor Vendor\n1x Player Stash\n1x Restock\nPre-Pandemic\nBefore the\npandemic\n, the Flatiron District was a thriving neighborhood known for it's architectural grandeur and dynamic energy. The Flatiron Building, completed in 1902, was a symbol of\nNew York\n\u2019s early skyscraper era, it's triangular shape earning it the nickname \"the Flatiron\" due to it's resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron. The district was a magnet for tech startups, advertising agencies, and creative firms, earning the moniker \"Silicon Alley\" in the 21st century. Trendy restaurants, boutique shops, and Madison Square Park\u2019s greenery made it a favorite for locals and tourists alike. The neighborhood pulsed with life, blending historic charm with modern ambition.\nThe Green Poison Outbreak\nWhen the\nGreen Poison\nswept through\nNew York City\nduring\nBlack Friday\n, the Flatiron District was hit hard. The virus, spread via contaminated currency, turned the crowded holiday shopping season into a death trap. As panic gripped the city, the district's dense population and heavy foot traffic accelerated the\noutbreak\n. Businesses shuttered, streets emptied, and the once-lively Madison Square Park became a makeshift triage zone, littered with abandoned medical tents and body bags.\nThe federal government activated the Strategic Homeland Division (\nSHD\n) to restore order, but the Flatiron District descended into chaos. Looters ransacked stores, and factions like the\nRikers\n- escaped convicts from\nRikers Island\n- began carving out territory. The\nCleaners\n, a fanatical group of sanitation workers wielding flamethrowers, roamed the streets, burning infected bodies and anyone they deemed \"contaminated.\" Amid the anarchy, desperate civilians formed small survivor groups, hiding in boarded-up brownstones or scavenging for supplies."}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Bad Ideas Are Bad | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Bad Ideas Are Bad\nDescription\nDustin Xavier pitches an idea to Felix Sokolov for new gear.\nFelix dismisses the idea as outlandish.\nAudio\nhttps://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/File:End_of_Watch_-_Bad_Ideas_Are_Bad.ogg\nType\nComms\nSeries\nManhunt: End of Watch\nLocation\nWashington, D.C.\nPrevious\nNext\nThe Sandbox\nMe Too\nKESTREL:\nI don't know why you keep pitching me your dumbass ideas.\nMAGNUS:\nMy ideas aren't dumb.

Coupled with something like an equally short cooldown on Cluster Seekers, it was possible to crowd-control an entire wave of 10+ enemies while simultaneously dealing tens of millions of damage with ease and at very little risk.\nWe like seeing powerful combinations of skills being used together and want to encourage clever use of game mechanics, especially in terms of group synergy, but it should come at the cost of investing in highly specialized gear. With these changes, it is still possible to achieve a 10s or lower cooldown on both the Blinder Firefly and Cluster Seeker Mines, however it will require a more significant investment in Skill Haste to achieve such a powerful force-multiplier.\nHive:\nThe Stinger hive now applies the Bleed status effect on hit.\nCan now be picked up and placed down elsewhere.\nThe charges that remain when picked up are saved.\nNo longer uses a cooldown, but instead uses a charge-up mechanic similar to chem launcher.\nPulse:\nScanner Pulse base cooldown increased from 40s to 60s.\nRemote Pulse base radius increased from 12m to 15m.\nSeeker Mine:\nIncreased damage of Explosive Seeker Mine by 20%.\nNow applies Bleed status effect.\nIncreased damage of Cluster Seeker Mines by +30%.\nIncreased cooldown of Cluster Seeker Mines from 40s to 60s.\nLowered quantity of Cluster Seeker Mines from 4 to 3.\nIncrease cooldown of Blinder Firefly from 60s to 90s.\nDeveloper Notes\n: We've seen an overall positive reception from the community in regard to the improvements to skills and skill haste in TU5, and it's been great to see players theory crafting and using their new and improved builds. With skill-based builds becoming more and more common at the end-game however, it was clear that some combination of skills had become overly disruptive to the intended experience.\nIn particular, the generous increase to skill haste on gear coupled with the reduced base cooldown of Cluster Seekers meant achieving a very short cooldown was relatively easy. While we're happy with the damage output of the Cluster Seeker itself, the skill does more than just blow things up, as it effectively causes NPCs to panic; frequently flushing them out of or away from cover, leading to even more damage received.\nFor this reason, the Cluster Seeker can be seen as a significant force multiplier, especially in group content. Because encounter balance and cadence is important for creating not just challenging combat, but a satisfying overall experience, we felt it necessary to increase the cooldown of Cluster Seekers to 60s (still remaining 30s shorter than its TU4 counterpart) and lower the number of mines deployed by 1, while giving it a boost in damage to compensate; ensuring it remains your best choice when it comes to eliminating multiple spread-out targets at once. The increase in damage and the addition of the Bleed status effect to the Explosive Seeker Mine should also increase its attractiveness and make choosing between it and the Cluster variant a more meaningful choice.\nTurret:\nAssault Turret and Sniper Turret damage is now affected by the Damage to Elites attribute.\nIncreased drain on Incinerator Turret active duration when firing.\nTalents\nNew talents:\nComposure:\nWhile in cover, grants +10% total weapon damage.\nComposure can be found on kneepad items.

This means players will have to compose builds of unique talent combinations instead of stacking one talent on all pieces. To compensate for this, all of the basic talents have gotten boosts to their power level.\nBerserk:\u00a0Nerf\nPVE: +8% (down from 10%) weapon damage for every 20% of max armor depleted.\nBloodlust: New functionality\nSwapping weapons grants +15% weapon damage for 5s.

It serves as the capital city of the United States and is home to all three branches of the federal government. Before the\noutbreak\nit had a native population of seven hundred thousand, although commuters from the surrounding Virginia and Maryland suburbs would swell the D.C. population to well more than a million inhabitants during the workweek.\nSince the\nGreen Poison\npandemic swept through the federal district last year, the population has plummeted. After the initial outbreak,\nCERA\nset up refugee camps to house the large tourist population stranded in D.C. with nowhere to go. But smallpox and mob violence has slashed the number of residents and refugees by at least two-thirds. Many surviving civilians banded together to build small settlements that held together despite power outages, predatory raiders, and bouts of malnutrition.\nContents\n1\nHistory\n2\nEvents of Tom Clancy's The Division 2\n3\nZones\n3.1\nOpen World\n3.2\nDark Zones\n3.3\nOutskirts\n4\nNotable Locations\n5\nFactions\n5.1\nFriendly\n5.2\nHostile\n6\nGallery\n7\nTrivia\n8\nReferences\nHistory\n\u201c\nEver since the JTF imploded, the city's become a playground for murderous fuckheads. There are several main factions and a whole lot of bottom feeders sucking up whatever the big dogs miss.\n-\nManny Ortega\n, on the state of Washington, D.C. after the collapse of the Washington JTF\n\u201d\nAs the\nGreen Poison\noutbreak wreaked havoc in\nManhattan\n, officials in D.C. scrambled to find a viable solution to the chaos that was enveloping the nation. After much deliberation,\nPresident Waller\nsigned the executive order known as\nDirective 51\ninto law, activating agents of the\nStrategic Homeland Division\nand sending them into\nNew York\n. Shortly afterward, Waller died of a heart attack.\nThe disease soon spread beyond Manhattan and found its way to the capital with devastating implications. Initially, those infected with the Green Poison were forcibly quarantined on\nRoosevelt Island\n, but the quarantine was unsuccessful, allowing the disease to spread throughout the city. The disenfranchised survivors of the Roosevelt Island quarantine would become the faction known as the\nOutcasts\n.\nCERA\n, the\nJTF\nand newly-appointed\nPresident Mendez\nattempted to maintain control of the city, but their attempts ended in disaster, leading to further chaos and unrest that was quickly grasping the city. Government officials tried to snuff out the virus by dousing infected areas with a experimental chemical known as\nDC-62\n, but the chemical ended up being far more toxic than anticipated and left the areas uninhabitable, leading to the creation of the\nD.C. Dark Zones\n. To make matters worse, the D.C. JTF force, already incredibly weakened, began to further collapse as a large part of the organization defected and formed a rogue paramilitary faction known as the\nTrue Sons\n, led by former JTF Officer\nAntwon Ridgeway\n. Finally, President Mendez died barely a week into his term, allegedly taking his own life.\nDeclaring the capital a loss, officials ordered a mass evacuation of all government and JTF personnel. Remaining members of the government and JTF evacuated via helicopter, leaving behind a skeleton crew of JTF operatives at the White House\nBase of Operations\n. With the JTF no longer able to somewhat maintain order, the city descended into anarchy, with the Outcasts, the True Sons, and a scavenger faction known as the\nHyenas\nestablishing territory while looting, killing, and pillaging at random. The United States capital became a full-blown war zone, with innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. These civilians would eventually band together as a ragtag militia, forming settlements and supply chains across the ruins of the city and fighting to regain territory from the rival factions.\nSometime after the evacuation, while transporting newly-appointed\nPresident Ellis\n, Air Force One was shot down over D.C. by unknown forces, causing it to crash in front of the\nCapitol Building\n. No trace of the President was found at the crash site, and he has been missing ever since.\nEvents of Tom Clancy's The Division 2\nSix months after the\noutbreak\n, the\nSHD Network\nexperiences a global blackout, and\nDivision\nagents receive a distress call from Washington, D.C. Upon arrival, the city is in ruins, with various factions fighting over territory and the streets littered with garbage and debris. Division Coordinator\nManny Ortega\nis in charge of SHD operations in the D.C. area, and tasks agents with various missions to help restore the SHD Network and reclaim the city from the warring factions.\nWith the help of\nJTF\npersonnel, the\nCivilian Militia\n, and the still-alive\nPresident Ellis\n, The Division wages a campaign against the factions, culminating in a full assault on the\nTrue Sons\noccupied\nCapitol Building\n. With all the faction leaders eliminated, the SHD Network restored, and the territory reclaimed, the survivors of D.C. celebrate. However, the city is soon thrown into chaos again when a new faction known as\nBlack Tusk\ninvades D.C., turning the city into a full-blown war zone. The heavily-armed PMC group has been tasked with eliminating The Division and taking back the capital, as well as securing a series of broad-spectrum antivirals for use against future outbreaks. The Division eventually mounts an assault against their stronghold, stealing the antivirals and disabling their transportation. A Black Tusk operative named\nWyvern\ngoes rogue and attempts to blow up\nThe White House\n, but is neutralized by Division agents.\nZones\nMain article:\nLocations/Tom_Clancy's_The_Division_2\nThe playable area consists of 13 PvE zones and 3 PvP\nDark Zones\n, as well as five\nStrongholds\n.\nEach Zone in the open-world consists of a small region of the map that contains a\nSafe House\n(or\nSettlement\n), at least 2\nControl Points\n, and usually has some sort of mission in the area.

He felt the pain, which pleased both\nClaire Ortiz\nand\nCalvin McManus\n.\nOnce the\noutbreak\nwas unleashed, he spent his time in the early days trying to combat the growing chaos while watching his friends succumb to the disease. In that time, Brian saw things that emotionally scarred him deeply, and he was still processing that trauma.\nThe early days of the outbreak were hard days for Brian. All his friends in Baltimore, especially at the BPD died and he stayed at Fort Meade, trying to forget those terrible things. Some day, two Division agents arrived at the Fort. They introduced them as\nCaleb Dunne\nand\nHeather Ward\n. They need help to decrypt a device which should hold information on\nMantis\n. Meeting Ward and Dunne was a good thing for Brian, seeing their clear sense of mission was a huge motivation for him. He realized that there was no more time to hide and think about the bad days of the early outbreak and all the sad happenings during this time. He got back his self-confidence and his strength.\nHe pushed aside the bad memories and after a few days with Dunne and Ward he was fully briefed on Mantis and so he decided to join them on their mission.\nNot long after his arrival in\nWashington, D.C.\n, Agent Johnson mysteriously disappeared, leading his fellow agents Heather Ward and Caleb Dunne to believe he either went\nRogue\nor was killed. It was neither, Johnson, being loyal to\nCalvin McManus\n's ideals, ended up joining the\nHunter Program\nthrough unknown means and becoming one of their highest ranking officers. At some point, he contacted\nJTF Squad Proteus\nto bring a\nMobile SHD Server\nto\nKenly College\nin the outskirts of D.C., though he didn't arrive to the location. Why Johnson wasn't there is not known, but it could be deduced that he waited for the\nOutcasts\nto kill off the squad and pry the server from their hands, though that didn't happen as the Outcasts in Kenly College got ambitious and used the server and the supplies from Proteus to plan a devastating attack towards D.C.\nAfter the events of\nWarlords of New York\n, he was directly tasked by Calvin McManus to train and observe\nJack Bonney\nas potential recruit for the program, giving him access to an\nSHD Smart Watch\nwith Classified Status, as well as access to the Hunters' Unidentified network. During a mission to\nJefferson Trade Center\n, The Recruiter, accompanied by Bonney's\nB.T.S.U.\n, would slaughter most of Captain\nFrederick Lewis\n's\nTrue Sons\n, leaving him as the sole survivor, who would later team up with The Division.\nAs Division agents stormed the facility and slowly took down the B.T.S.U. operatives, he would often make himself known, appearing from time to time only to taunt the agents, disappearing in a cloud of blue smoke whenever the agents got too close.\nDespite Bonney's confidence and efforts to impress his superior, he was eventually killed in action by the agents, even with the help of the Recruiter's\nSHD Tech\n, leaving the Hunter to disappear once more in his cloud of blue colored smoke.\nThe Recruiter is mentioned once again when he escorted the hostage\nJohn Yazzie\nand gave him to\nGabriel \"Dynamite\" Gonzalez\n. Later, when the agents are rescuing\nMari Singh\nat the\nManning National Zoo\n, The Recruiter can be seen in a blue smoke-screen on top of a balcony, simply watching as the agents extract the hostage after having killed B.T.S.U. operative\nFelicity \"Panther\" Lee\n.\nAfter the successful rescue of Mari Singh, he would take a more active role in dealing with the remaining hostages, as the Hunter would now be hunted down himself.\nThe following days after Mari's rescue, The Recruiter would be responsible for overseeing the escort of captured hostages\nCindy McAllister\n,\nMel Arnold\n,\nJack Arnold\n,\nVikram Malik\nand his sister \"Birdie\". Simultaneously, Johnson would show up at the Castle Settlement and pretend to help to agents with each of the rescues, not showing his true intentions, which were to gain their trust in order to recover the mobile SHD server and bring it to\nNatalya Sokolova\n.\nAfter the rescue of Vikram Malik, Johnson and the agents go to\nCamp White Oak\nin order to rescue his sister, \"\nBirdie\n\", bringing the server with them. Amidst instabilities in the server and the agents assault on the Black Tusk and True Sons soldiers at the camp, Birdie reveals to the agents she was told by Sokolova that the Division and Black Tusk were now allies, and she was sent there alongside agent Johnson, who she reveals that Johnson was the traitor to the Division cause.\nJohnson, after realizing that his cover was blown due to Birdie's info, and in a desperate attempt to escape Camp White Oak with the stolen server, engages the agents in combat while waiting for the extraction helicopter sent by Natalya. During the fight, Johnson is mostly protected by his SHD Defender Drone, leading Birdie to use the Black Tusk's countermeasure to deactivate both his and the agents' SHD tech, leaving him temporarily vulnerable. After a tough battle, the Sheriff heads back into the lodge, leaving Johnson to be hit by a mortar strike sent by Birdie, collapsing on the floor and succumbing from his injuries.\nBefore his death, Johnson left behind a series of insurance comms in D.C., where it was discovered by Division agents. Those comms explain his disappearance, his discontent with Agent Kelso's methods, as well his motivations to join the Hunter program.\nLegacy\nBrian's death and his identity shook things for the Division and their allies in Washington, D.C. The agents were forced to face the harsh reality that Hunters are embedded among them, raising suspicion and doubt in the White House and Castle settlements, even questioning if Agent Alani Kelso can be trusted, given her former CIA background. While Kelso did go rogue, she is no Hunter, as she's allied herself with Aaron Keener and Theo Parnell to help in stopping the Black Tusk and the Hunters.\nDuring one of their incursions in the Descent simulation facility, Division agents intercept a comm of Keener and Bridgette Douglas where they discuss about recruiting Jack Arnold. Apparently, Jack was tricked by the Hunters to go to Kenly College where she and her squad were left to die. Therefore, it can be concluded that Brian deliberately sent Jack and her JTF squad Proteus to their deaths so he could pry the Mobile SHD Server from their custody.\nPersonality\nBrian Johnson is haunted with emotional scars over the chaos of the\nGreen Poison\nand the loss of his friends, leading him to be a recluse. His meeting and friendship he struck with\nHeather Ward\nand\nCaleb Dunne\nallowed him to regain his self-confidence and steel his resolve. However, by the time he became a\nHunter\n, he cut contact with them, as he believed his work is more important. And due to personal history with\nCalvin McManus\n, he's loyal to Cal's ideals for the United States.\nHe had personal resentment towards\nAlani Kelso\n, as he felt her methods are reckless for a\nDivision\nagent and believed that she'd go\nrogue\n. He was also manipulative as he used the Division and\nJTF\nduring the events of\nPuppeteers\nto get access to the\nMobile SHD Server\nand put an end to the conflict. A similar case happened with\nJTF Squad Proteus\nwhen he ordered them to bring a Mobile SHD Server to\nKenly College\n.\nJohnson was known to be dogmatic in his belief, believing in the ideals that Calvin McManus has for the United States and that the Division should devote itself to thr mission of what it was supposed to be: Ensure continuity of government. During his confrontation with Division agents, Brian claimed that he and his fellow Hunters are the ones on mission and accused the agents of being off-mission and going rogue the moment they allied with\nKelso\nregardless of what\nISAC\nthinks.\nEquipment\nPromotional Material\nIn the promotional action figurine, Brian Johnson is armed with a\nTAC-50 C Rifle\n,\nBeretta M9\n,\nVector 45 ACP\n,\nFlash Bangs\n, and a Ka-Bar combat knife.\nThe promotional cinematic/live-action/gameplay trailers includes a\nStinger Hive\n,\nT821\n,\nM4 carbine\n,\nRhino Revolver\nand a\nAUG A3-CQC\n.\nBrian Johnson's backpack trophy is the 'Tommy the Teddy Bear'.\nIn-game (as The Recruiter)\nIn-game, The Recruiter is a unique Hunter armed with a\nTAC-50 C Rifle\n,\nCustom P416 G3\n,\nSHD Defender Drone\n,\nJammer Pulse\nand\nAirburst Incendiary Grenades\n. Like other Hunters, he could also hack the player's skills.\nTrivia\nBrian Johnson's backpack trophy, 'Tommy the Teddy Bear', was an exclusive pre-order bonus for the PC version\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n; however, the code itself was compatible with the PC, PS4, or Xbox One versions of the game.\nDuring his brief appearances in\nSeason 9\nand\nYear 5 Season 1\n, The Recruiter's re-used the Crimson Hunter's (nicknamed \"Jiang Ziya\") name, model, weapons and skills. Later, in Year 5 Season 2, his appearance was remodeled to have his own unique look (this included changing his in-game model in his previous appearances).\nPrior to his design change in Y5S2, The Recruiter was depicted as a Hunter armed with a\nBlack Market M60 E6\n,\nTactical UMP-45\n,\nSHD Bombardier Drones\n,\nSHD Riot Foam Chem-Launcher\n,\nJammer Pulse\nand\nConcussion Grenades\n. He also had a Striker Drone that hovers in place beside him, but neither him nor his drone engage the player directly.\nPrior to the Y5S2.1 Update, The Recruiter could be seen (already in his new design) holding an\nM1A CQB\n, this was swapped for a\nTAC-50 C Rifle\nto match with the season's launch trailer.\nDuring his appearance in\nJefferson Trade Center Manhunt: Captain Lewis\n, the Recruiter never engages the player directly, only sending modified EMP Drones to aid\nJack Bonney\nand the\nBlack Tusk\nduring their fight against the\nDivision\n.\nHowever, it is possible to prompt him to attack the player on extremely rare instances.\nDespite never being mentioned in the mission's dialogue, the Recruiter does appear at the very end of\nManning National Zoo: Save Mari Singh\n, right after the player shoots the flare to call Torres for extraction. He appears in a blue smoke screen on the window of the overlook where\nFelicity \"Panther\" Lee\nwas previously at.\nBrian Johnson had appeared commercially in Ubisoft's live action trailer of [\nTHE DIVISION 2 - DRAWING LIVE ACTION TRAILER\n], [\nTHE DIVISION 2 - GOOD GUY LIVE ACTION TRAILER\n] and [\nClancy's The Division 2: Official Cinematic TV Spot | Ubisoft [NA\n] [\nClancy's The Division 2: E3 2019 Episode 3 Teaser Trailer | Ubisoft [NA\n]\nSince Episode 3 Teaser Trailer was the last appearance of Brian Johnson as a Division Agent, It is presumed that during his travel to New York with\nCaleb Dunne\nand\nHeather Ward\n, Brian manage to somehow join the Hunters.\nBrian Johnson was commercially featured as a statue figurine and as an action/articulated figurine.\nIt is still unknown why ISAC did not detect the Hunter network whenever Johnson showed up at the Castle Settlement prior to the reveal of his identity as The Recruiter.\nBrian Johnson is the second Hunter in the franchise to have voice lines and also involved in a main story mission.\nUnlike most of his fellow Hunters, The Recruiter doesn't have Smart Watches stitched to his uniform.\nBrian Johnson's outfit from the\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nE3 2018 trailer is available as a downloadable Outfit from\nUbisoft Connect\nfor 100 Units.\nGallery\nJohnson as a Division agent\nJohnson and his team\nJohnson, as he appears in\nTom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis\nThe Recruiter's keyart in Puppeteers\nRecruiter in\nJefferson Trade Center\nMissions\nJefferson Trade Center Manhunt: Captain Lewis\nManning National Zoo: Save Mari Singh\nCamp White Oak: The Recruiter\nOther Media\nTom Clancy's Elite Squad\nBrian Johnson was featured in\nTom Clancy's Elite Squad\nas part of The Division faction.

She grew up on a secluded estate in the Scottish Highlands. After attending university, Douglas completed an eight-year stint in the\nSpecial Air Service\nbefore taking a position in D&H as a logistics and supply specialist. When\nGreen Poison\nhit, she was immediately recruited by\nBlack Tusk\n, and despite her father's objections she joined Black Tusk.\nHistory\nPrior to Tom Clancy's The Division 2\nBridgette grew as typical of children of rich and powerful folks, living in the shadow of her father's company. Due to her upbringing, she was expected to act as the perfect daughter in the higher echelon of society throughout, giving her father and his company many contracts. During her upbringing, she struck a friendship with\nMackenzie Meret\nand\nNatalya Sokolova\n.\nHer act got the attention of\nCalvin McManus\n, who gave her a smart watch and was given basic SHD training. She was also selected to be part of the Hunter program. When the Green Poison outbreak hit the country, she wasn't activated as a Division agent, leading her to be immediately recruited by Black Tusk. Not long after her recruitment, Bridge attempted to convince Mackenzie to join Black Tusk. However, Mack wanted nothing to do with Black Tusk nor with Natalya Sokolova. The fact that Douglas was also in allegiance with the PMC soured her friendship with Mack.\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nHowever, she'd have second guesses about her allegiance with Black Tusk, presumably due to learning about  Sokolova's true intentions. Wanting to set things right, she found herself in contact with Aaron Keener. During the events of Division 2's base story, she fed him intel about her father's whereabouts as well as intel on President Ellis. It was her intel about Ellis's residence in Camp White Oak that had \"Luna\" leak intel about the president's whereabouts to the Division, allowing Keener and his rogues time to work on deploying the Rogue network.\nWarlords of New York\nDuring the events of Warlords of New York, Douglas was coerced by Keener to act as the honeypot to Faye Lau, convincing the latter to join Black Tusk so they could undermine the organization and the Hunters. It took some time, but Lau managed to infiltrate Black Tusk. Throughout the course of WONY's campaign, she questioned Keener about letting his lieutenants die, though she'd be surprised when she learns that Theo Parnell is alive thanks to deceiving ISAC with a decoy and a copy of ANNA, tricking the Division into believing he's dead.\nAfter Warlords of New York\nAfter the events of WONY, Douglas still corresponded with Keener, revealing that due to Mackenzie's refusal in joining Black Tusk, she basically signed her death warrant. The two discussed about Mack with Keener having romantic admiration for her, prompting Douglas to call him a lovesick puppy. She remarked that if he and Mack got together, Sokolova would try to get rid of him since he's not the first suitor for Mack, calling Nat a Hydra who's each head is happy to get rid of the competition.\nAt some point, Douglas reached out to Major Amanda Xander, her ex-girlfriend, to try and talk things with Faye Lau. Xander wanted nothing to do with Lau as she held a grudge against the agent, even informing General Anderson about Black Tusk's involvement, warning Natalya Sokolova to not interfere further after he cut ties with the organization.\nDouglas also shared intel to Keener on Sokolova's control of the manufacturing process, which she has complete control \"in all the ways that matters\". She felt a bit uncomfortable over Keener's change of heart, in which he retorted that they all have to evolve if they want to survive. Douglas admitted that she was actively trying to be away from Nat's leash, and Keener tried to convince her to stop \"wearing the Black Tusk girdle\". However, Douglas preferred to stay as \"Operation Cassandra\" depended on her staying in Nat's good graces.\nEnd of Watch\nLater on, she got put in a team with Faye Lau, where she'd work in logistics for Lau's operation. The two struck a relationship, though it's unknown if Douglas told her she's part of the Hunter program. Regardless, when Lau and her lieutenants got on the Division's radar, agents would hunt Douglas down in Southwest of Washington, D.C. and end her.\nFirst Rogue\nThroughout various comms collected during the trials set by Aaron Keener, the agents learn more about Bridgette Douglas and her partnership with Keener. The comms first delves into her father, Charles Douglas, and her love-hate relationship she has for him given how she felt mistreated by him when he groomed her to be the perfect daughter to squeeze rich people for his business, and her father's position in the White House.\nThen it later delves into other topics, starting Douglas sharing President Ellis' location at Camp White Oak to Keener, allowing him to share it to\n\"Luna\"\nto buy time in deploying the Rogue Network nationally. Later comms delve into Douglas informing Keener that Mackenzie Meret \"signing\" her \"death warrant\" for refusing to join Natalya Sokolova's Black Tusk, and teasing him for his crush on the former socialite, then sharing what she knows about Nat's control over the manufacturing process in her organization while actively trying to look for ways to get herself out of the CEO's leash.\nAll in all, the comms revealed Douglas changing sides as she wanted nothing to do with Black Tusk and partnering with Keener to help him out in his mission to stop Black Tusk and the Hunters.\nShades of Red\nWhile she wasn't heard in the comms intercepted by SHD Agents during their trail to find\n\"Glasses\"\n, Bridgette Douglas was heard in various comms intercepted during their incursions in the Descent simulation facility, where she was first heard giving reports to Natalya Sokolova about the state of things in Coney Island, Lower Manhattan, and Brooklyn as part of her \"recon mission\".\nBut for the most part, the comms involved Douglas talking with Aaron Keener about recruiting people for his settlement. A number of them happened to be members from the Castle Settlement the Division agents rescued while they were under Black Tusk's custody. Though there two people that weren't members of the Castle, Maral McCarthy and Rodney Bishop. Douglas was apprehensive about having Maral as the social director of Keener's settlement, given she's pregnant with Theo's child and claiming the settlement is ground zero, which turned into a discussion that the former friendship Keener had with Calvin McManus.\nThen came Rodney Bishop, who was hired by Keener to be in charge of the supplies, which Douglas had misgivings as she thinks Bishop is a fanboy who's in love with the idea of who Keener is. Though, she does admit that having someone like Bishop spreading the gospel of his hero helps things for the settlement.\nAfter the Division rescued Parnell for extraction at the NOA HQ and dealing with the Hyenas, they recovered 4 comms during the assault. One comm, in particular, involved Parnell reviewing the Hunter roster which confirmed that Bridgette Douglas is indeed a Hunter. This comm took place few months ago, as Douglas was Keener's ace in the hole to help Faye Lau infilitrate Black Tusk. While Parnell was apprehensive at first, he was convinced when Keener vouched for Douglas, remarking that she kept him out of trouble a number of times.\nInterestingly enough, when discussing about Birdie Malik with Keener, Douglas mentioned that Birdie alongside her adopted brother Vikram were sent to the Castle Settlement which happened during the events of\nPuppeteers\n. This implies that Douglas survived her encounter with the Division agents in Washington, D.C. using the hologram technology that Keener and Parnell procured from the Descent simulation program. If so, her current whereabouts are unknown.\nBurden of Truth\nDuring the Division's latest incursion to the Descent simulation facility, Bridgette Douglas was heard in a comm between her and Keener, where she confirmed that Bardon Schaeffer was alive and sent to the White House after his tussle against the agents in Coney Island. However, because Schaeffer was in a coma due to the injuries he sustained, he couldn't deliver Faye Lau's message in the White House, and Douglas expressed that\nshe was set to be next in the Division's hit-list.\nAdditionally, Douglas would be heard again through the intel the agents are recovering during their trail to find Agent Kelso in D.C, as she had a role in the whole mess with Lau, the Cassandra mission, and Bardon Schaeffer.\nHoney Pot\nAfter following the first intel in East Mall, Division agents intercepted a comm between Aaron Keener and Douglas, after the latter met with Faye Lau. Douglas was hesitant to share the truth, but Keener encouraged her to be honest as no relationship based on lies ever survives. This changed to a personal conversation about Keener's envy of the human connection he saw in the Morretis, Theo and Maral, and his crush on Mackenzie Meret. Of course, Douglas seemed to prefer sarcastic megalomaniac Keener over the emotionally mature Keener.\nMeet Cute\nAfter they followed the second intel in Southwest, Division agents intercepted a comm between Douglas and Keener, where she shared a bit of her conversation with Faye Lau during their meeting to Keener. Keene admitted that Lau didn't expect Douglas having attraction to women, which she proudly admitted though mentioned that wasn't good for her father's business, which Keener disliked about. She then asked Keener of his opinion towards Lau, where he believes she's dangerous for her, though Douglas retorted she wouldn't betray them. Keener agreed, but recommended Douglas to not sleep with Lau. Douglas argues that'd blow her cover, and commented that being in the Black Tusk is like living in the Olympic Village, where beautiful people in peak condition often sleep together because they don't have anything to do between fights.\nKeener conceded to his friend's point, telling her to do what she to do, but stay focused nonetheless.\nThe Mission\nWhen Division agents followed the third intel, they intercept a comm that involved a discussion between Douglas and Keener, where the former admits that she'd understand and wouldn't be disappointed if Lau refused to take the mission to kill President Ellis. Keener argues that's less extreme than what she's already done. Douglas, on the other hand, argues that it'll involve a lot of roleplaying and an uncomfortable outfit. Moreover, Lau will have to talk to Ellis, be respectful to him, and make him feel like the most important person in the world, which Keener admits was a challenge as Ellis was an idiot, which Douglas also agreed upon.\nStill, given that Ellis was the only who had access to \"The Ark Protocol\" and was yet to resign or name his successor, that emphasized the importance of Lau's mission. Though, Douglas preferred calling it \"the football\" as she finds the clandestine naming stuff hard to follow and kind of annoying.\nGreen Light\nWhen agents of the Division followed the fourth intel, they interceped a comm where Douglas confirms to Keener that Faye Lau is committed in her mission, playing the politics. And if necessary, kill President Ellis, especially she refused to call him POTUS. In addition, she'll go through\nNatalya Sokolova'\ns tests for the rebuilt BTSU, test her skills as a leader and antagonise the hell out of\nBardon Schaeffer\nfor Nat's pleasure.\nKeener was confused at the last part, since he thought Schaeffer was Nat's most loyal soldier. However, Douglas mentions that Schaeffer got kicked from Ellis' security detail, and Nat had to solve a problem that he created. And in Nat's mind, that made Schaeffer her sworn enemy.\nDouglas would go further in exemplifying Nat's flaws. She doesn't tolerate being questioned or breaking her system. Efficiency at all costs. Acceptable loss is personnel. And as far as Natalya is concerned, her systems are infallible and cannot be questioned.\nKeener commented that Douglas makes Nat sound like a psychopath, and Douglas wondered if Nat is a narcissist or undiagnosed autistic, but doesn't really know. Whatever the case, Douglas vented further about Nat, mentioning that she never admits she's ever done anything wrong, which was more exemplified when no one told Nat no during her childhood, which turned her into a privileged asshole as an adult. Lastly, Douglas mentions Natalya as a prime example of a privileged asshole who's given unlimited resources and a private army, which sets the picture for the current situation that Douglas and Keener were dealing with.\nRed Light\nPrior to\nSchaeffer going to Coney Island to act as bait for the Division\n, Douglas tried to convince him not to go through with it. Schaeffer is still all in on this, believing it can't be for nothing and mentioned that she's the one who got him into this. Douglas was frustrated about this predicament, and expressed that it's not fair, considering that she, Schaeffer, and Lau are gonna be meeting death. Schaeffer argued that it's the quality of time that matters, and encouraged her to spend as much time as possible with her girlfriend, as it may be their last time together.\nJust then, Douglas learned her Smart Watch turned red, because ISAC thinks that she's off-mission. Therefore, Douglas was convinced by Schaeffer to leave him to do his mission and go see Faye.\nChickenhawk\nDouglas gives an update to Keener and Schaeffer that Faye Lau has access to President Ellis, as the POTUS liked her enough to be in his security detail. While Keener was glad his plan was working, Schaeffer was wondering who's the next line of succession if Ellis doesn't give clearance to Lau for the key to The Ark, so Douglas confirms that it'll be automaticali given the Secretary of Agriculture, who was working at a CERA base in Arkansas.\nSchaeffer felt apprehensive, knowing that Nat would try to have the Secretary killed so\nCal\ngets the Key. But Douglas tried to assuage his concern, mentioning that Nat would have an easier time pretending to be the hero if she doesn't indiscrimentally kill politicans to install her puppet. One \"suicide\" could be ignored, but seventeen untimely deaths is a pattern that couldn't be explained away.\nUnfortunately for the trio, the Secretary of Agriculture would die of Anaphylaxis due to her allergic reaction to sesame oil. Therefore, the key to The Ark had now passed to Calvin McManus.\nVanguard\nSchaeffer was shocked when he learned that Douglas is best friends with Aaron \"Vanguard\" Keener, with Douglas explaining that they've always been friends and always will be. When asked if she ever hooked up with the rogue agent, Douglas was so grossed out she had to emphasize she's just friends with Keener, nothing more.\nGlasses\nDouglas was with Schaeffer when they talked to ANNA, where Schaaeffer asks the AI what she thinks of Theo Parnell. ANNA answers that she considers \"Glasses\" as the kindest, smartest, and most handsome person who have ever lived, which led to Schaeffer asking if Theo programmed her to say that. ANNA admits that's the case, but her praises for Parnell are mostly true. This led to Douglas asking what's the lie, which ANNA answered that Theo is not the most handsome and considers \"Vanguard\" as the most handsome. Of course, this grossed out Douglas and she asked the AI if he programmed her to say that. ANNA commented that Keener did not know how to program her, but he knows how to make her feel good, which again made Douglas feel gross about it.\nDuring the conversation, Schaeffer noticed vocal similarities between Douglas and the AI, and asks her if she voiced ANNA. Douglas did not, and commented that Claire the one who built her. Schaeffer was confused, which baffled Douglas as she gave him the briefs about Claire, which Schaeffer didn't read on given he was a little busy. Nonetheless, Douglas tells him that Theo didn't build ANNA, he simply set her free.\nClaire Ortiz\nis the one who built ANNA, and if they want this conflict to end, they need Claire.\nAsset\nDouglas discussed with Schaeffer about Natalya Sokolova's asset in Washington D.C, where she expressed her worries that it could be more than one asse. When asked by Schaeffer if her father is one of them, she commented that it's possible given Charles' acquaintance with Sokolova, though she also mentioned that Nat is in many circles within D.C. For all Douglas knows, the asset could be a Kenly College student who took a summer internship at Sokolov Concern, one of Cal's Hunters, or even an actor that Nat hired.\nThe third one amused Schaeffer, remarking it'd be funny if the fate of the free world depended on an actor.\nFish Tacos\nDouglas discuss about\nthe Castle\nwith Schaeffer, where the latter noted her jealousy. She denied it at first, but admitted her jealousy of the work that Lauren Fong and Amanda Weekes were doing in the settlement was making a difference, while all she's doing is clandestine murder sprees. Douglas wasn't amused by Schaeffer's teasing, though she relented when she felt hungry and wanting to eat a fish taco.\nRecruiter\nDouglas discusses about the Hunters with Keener, but more specifically Brian Johnson. She admits that she didn't know him, but she's familiar with him as she often had recruitment dinners with other agents in the program like David, Joe, or Dicky. Keener then mused that his life and Douglas's life were very different back then, even admitting that Douglas wouldn't look at Faye Lau twice, as he likes seeing the couple together, which led Keener to ask if it's horrible he's glad that Amherst blew up the world.\nDouglas admits it's horrible, but knows that Keener is trying to be a good friend to her. However, she soon faces the reality that with Schaeffer in Division's custody and in a coma, they'll be coming for her and Lau next. She was on the verge of tears, where Keener reminded her quality of time spent that matters most. With that in mind, Douglas takes her leave to see Lau one last time.\nNat\nDouglas asked Keener if he ever spent too much time making excuses for someone's behavior that they tend to forget why they're friends with that person to begin with. Keener admits that he never did that as he never lets people very close to him and pushes away anyone who pisses him off. This led to a rant from Douglas about Mackenzie Meret, about how she's never going to change, and will never be satisfied nor happy, and too old to change\nWhile Keener did retort that Mack is 40 years old, Douglas argued that Mack had always been like that since she was 16, it's who she is, and she never has incentive to change. This led to Keener questioning Douglas if she's talking about Natalya Sokolova.\nDouglas calls Nat the saddest person she's ever met, and looking so perfect to others is her superpower. During the talk, she continued her rant, first talking about how it's easily to figure out someone's dream when they say it. But it when comes to Nat, she tends to fulfill a person's deepest desires by scanning a person's face, have the algorithm search every piece on intel on them for hopes and dreams, and it pops up on her smart lens or watch, so she could make anyone's dreams come true.\nKeener couldn't decide if that's amazing or horrifying, where Douglas says it's both. When people have amazing dreams, it can be amazing. But the people who dream of horrible and vile things? That's the world. The world that Douglas and Keener are living in. Sick and twisted, but also glorious and beautiful. Full of possibility and pain.\nWatch\nDouglas shares the titanium bracelet that Mackenzie Meret to Bardon Schaeffer. He was surprised when he read the inappropriate inscription, with Douglas admitting she's the worst. This puzzled Schaeffer, as he knew Mack as a rich philanthropist, which is true. But as Douglas clarified, she's a jerk to her friends, all about ego and competition, and she pins the blame on Natalya Sokolova as these two women always tried to one up each other. Douglas feels that these two women should just have sex and calm down, but that'll never happen as Nat is too repressed and Mack is too much of being herself.\nDouglas clarifies this further, talking about Mack losing her parents at a young age, being shipped to a boarding school and hating her time there, as she didn't want her family's inheritance. Moreover,  Mack didn't want to feed the war machine, which meant never having kids to pass onto the inheritance for as long as she lives.\nShe reveals that Mack launched her fashion line as a joke to throw away the blood money. But in a twist of irony, the fashion line took off, and the blood money multiplied. And Douglas concludes by calling Mack as the sad rich spinster who tried to make up for generations of exploitation, which is never possible, so she spends her time getting drunk and growing tomatoes. And occasion, making titanium bracelets for her friends with inappropriate inscriptions.\nPersonality and Traits\nWIP\nAbilities\nIn-game, Viper was a\nRogue Agent\narmed with a\nBlack Market AK-M\n,\nNavy MP5-N\n,\nBombardier Drones\n,\nOxidizer Chem-Launcher\nand\nConcussion Grenades\n.\nViper Gear\nTrivia\nIn a few audio logs in Season 9, it's revealed that Viper had previously been in a romantic relationship with\nMajor Amanda Xander\nof the\nTrue Sons\n.\nAdditionally, it's also revealed that she was in a relationship with Faye Lau prior to both of their deaths.\nDue to her relationships with Amanda Xander and Faye Lau, it can be indicated that Viper is a lesbian. This is further proven in COMMs from Season 4: End of Watch, where she saw right through advances from Dustin \"Magnus\" Xavier, in addition to remarking that most men in the Black Tusk are not her type and wouldn't let them touch her after Alicia \"Circe\" Coswald told her to get laid.\nAnd to put the pin on that, the \"Meet Cute\" comm from Y6S3: Burden of Truth confirms Viper is a lesbian, as she calls herself a secret member of \"lesbian mafia\" since 1993.\nDespite never being seen using it in-game, she could also be seen holding an\nAUG A3 Para XS\nin her character artwork.\nBounty\nThe Snake Den\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division 2"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Title Update 17 | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Title Update 17\nis an update that was released for\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\non February 27, 2023.\nContents\n1\nManhunt\n2\nGear, Weapons & Talents\n2.1\nNew Exotic Weapon\n2.1.1\nSacrum Imperium\n2.2\nNew Exotic Gear\n2.2.1\nNinjaBike Messenger Bag\n2.3\nNew Gear\n2.3.1\nHotshot\n2.3.2\nChest and Backpack Bonuses\n2.4\nHabsburg Guard a.k.a. \"HG\"\n2.4.1\nChest and Backpack Bonuses\n2.5\nNew Named Weapons\n2.6\nProphet\n2.7\nRelic\n3\nBalancing Existing Gear\n4\nQuality of Life Changes\n4.1\nPVP\n5\nUI\n6\nOther Changes\n6.1\nGear & Talents\n7\nExpertise\n8\nPVP\n9\nUI\n10\nVanity\n11\nApparel Event\n11.1\nNecessary Tactics\n12\nSeason Pass\nManhunt\nWith the\nBlack Tusk\nand\nTrue Sons\nalliance solidified and\nCaptain Lewis\n's troops joining the Division, new battle lines are drawn.\nNatalya Sokolova\nhas come out of the shadows and is taking a more active and visible role leading the Black Tusk on more aggressive campaigns across Washington.\nAdditionally,\nHunters\nhave been more active in the capital and a new recruit emerges to help decipher encrypted Hunter Drone files.\nSeason 11 follows the story of the latest target to find -\nZachary \"Stovepipe\" Beattie\n, an Explosive Ordinance Disposal Specialist.

Combined with a high magazine capacity and other crit-related talents, this means the PP-19 is a reasonably effective close-range weapon that works quite well with the\nD3-FNC\nset bonus.\nThe weapon is used by\nRogue First-Wave Agents\nin legendary difficulties and also by some of the members of the\nHunters\n.\nWeapon Talents\nThe PP-19 weapons have two talents at random, with its third talent automatically rolling\nHurried\n.\nTalent\n|\nHurried\nCritical hits increase reload speed by 10% to a minimum of 1 seconds reload time.\nVariants\nPP-19\nEnhanced PP-19\nCurrently, the two PP-19 variants seem to be identical in terms of stats.\nGallery\nPP-19.\nEnhanced PP-19.\nTrivia\nThe PP-19's optic mount and base magazine capacity of 53 indicates that it's a\nBizon-2\nor\nBizon-3\nchambered in 9x19mm Parabellum as opposed to the original model, which has no rail for optics and is chambered in 9x18mm Makarov (holding 64 rounds per magazine instead).\nThe Enhanced PP-19 has aftermarket furniture of Magpul Zhukov-S stock and MOE grip.\nWeapons\nin\nTom Clancy's The Division\nAssault Rifles\nACR\n\u2022\nAK-47\n(\nWarlord\n) \u00a0\u2022\nFAL\n\u2022\nM4\n(\nLiberator\n) \u00a0\u2022\nPOF P416\n\u2022\nSCAR-L\n(\nCaduceus\n) \u00a0\u2022\nG36\n\u2022\nBullfrog\n\u2022\nUrban MDR\nLight Machine Guns\nL86 LSW\n\u2022\nM60\n(\nHungry Hog\n) \u00a0\u2022\nRPK-74\n(\nPakhan\n) \u00a0\u2022\nM249 B\n\u2022\nMG5\n\u2022\nBig Alejandro\nMarksman Rifles\nM44\n\u2022\nM1A\n(\nHistorian\n) \u00a0\u2022\nSRS\n\u2022\nSCAR-H\n(\nTenebrae\n) \u00a0\u2022\nSVD\n\u2022\nM700\n\u2022\nThe Devil's Heel\n(\nDevil\n/\nHeel\n)\nSubmachine Guns\nT821\n(\nMidas\n) \u00a0\u2022\nMP5\n\u2022\nMP7\n\u2022\nVector\n\u2022\nSMG-9\n(\nHildr\n/\nEir\n) \u00a0\u2022\nAUG A3\n\u2022\nPP-19\n\u2022\nUMP-45\n\u2022\nThompson M1928\n(\nTommy Gun\n) \u00a0\u2022\nThe House\nShotguns\nDouble Barrel Sawed Off\n(\nDefiler\n) \u00a0\u2022\nDouble Barrel Shotgun\n(\nCassidy\n) \u00a0\u2022\nM870\n\u2022\nSASG-12\n(\nMedved\n) \u00a0\u2022\nSuper 90\n\u2022\nShowstopper\nSidearms\nModel 686\n\u2022\nM1911\n(\nCenturion\n) \u00a0\u2022\nM9\n(\nDamascus\n) \u00a0\u2022\nPF45\n\u2022\nPx4 Storm\n\u2022\nX-45\n\u2022\n93R\n\u2022\nRhino\n(\nGolden Rhino\n)\nSHD Technology\nPulse\n\u2022\nFirst Aid\n\u2022\nSupport Station\n\u2022\nSticky Bomb\n\u2022\nTurret\n\u2022\nSeeker Mine\n\u2022\nBallistic Shield\n\u2022\nSmart Cover\n\u2022\nMobile Cover\n\u2022\nRecovery Link\n\u2022\nTactical Link\n\u2022\nSurvivor Link"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Amphibian Front (Bounty) | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Amphibian Front\nDetails\nEnemy Level\n40\nLocation\nFoggy Bottom\nDescription\nThe Amphibian Front\nspecializes in wet work and contaminating water sources to spread the virus.\nFactions\nOutcasts\nBoss\nThe Frog\nAmphibian Front\nis an\nOutcasts\nbounty featured in\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n.

If this powder hits you or your teammates, it restores an amount of your armor. Powder that sticks on the ground grants armor restoration over time. You have the ability to heal your friends very fast, or even yourself over time.\nThe Reinforcer can even be used by the\nAgent\nsimilarly as the\nFirst Aid\n, by dropping the Reinforcer in their vicinity to heal themselves and regenerate their armor. The Reinforcer variant uses green-colored canisters.\nThe Firestarter canister sends out flammable, near-invisible gas. These gas clouds can be ignited with any spark\u2014bullet impacts, enemies firing their weapons inside the cloud, explosions or even enemies running into them while on fire. If you combine multiple clouds over a large area, you can create devastating chain reactions.\nThe Firestarter variant uses red-colored canisters (though the gas cloud is clear when launched).\nThe Riot Foam fires a canister with riot control foam that disperses on impact. The foam is sticky, heavy, and it expands rapidly. Anyone affected by the foam is stuck in place for a period of time, but the hardened foam can be destroyed to break them free.\nThe Riot Foam variant uses dark beige-colored canisters.\nThe Oxidizer fires a canister that emits a cloud of corrosive chemicals. The chemical cloud lingers for a long time and efficiently eats away at the armor and health of enemies caught within its radius, as well as damage devices such as health stations, turrets, and drones.\nThe Oxidizer can be used to reliably damage enemies that are behind cover, as well as push them out of it, and can be devastating when fired at enemy spawn points. It can also be used to great effect against Rusher and Tank archetypes, due to the predictability of the former's movements and the slow and sluggishness of the latter's. The Oxidizer variant uses purple-colored canisters.\nGallery\nReinforcer Chem Launcher\nFirestarter Chem Launcher\nRiot Foam Chem Launcher\nOxidizer Chem Launcher\nAn agent using the Chem Launcher on True Sons enemies\nAppearances\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\nSHD Technology\nPulse\n\u2022\nSticky Bomb\n\u2022\nTurret\n\u2022\nSeeker Mine\n\u2022\nBallistic Shield\n\u2022\nChem Launcher\n\u2022\nDecoy\n\u2022\nDrone\n\u2022\nFirefly\n\u2022\nHive\n\u2022\nTrap"}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: Title Update 6.1 | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "Purge this page\nPurge the cache of this page?\nOK\nPurging a page clears the cache and forces the most current revision to appear."}, {"source": "Custom Wiki: John Yazzie | The Division Wiki | Fandom", "content": "John Yazzie\nBiographical Information\nAge\n32\nResidence\nCastle Settlement\nOccupation\nJTF Pilot (formerly)\nMaryland Army National Guard\nFlight Coordinator\nAffliliations\nFactions\nJoint Task Force\nJohn Yazzie\nis a pilot for the\nJoint Task Force\nappearing in\nTom Clancy's The Division 2\n.\nHe was featured in the\nMexican Embassy\nClassified Assignment\nand is one of the five hostages that\nDivision\nagents rescue in\nYear 5 Season 1: Broken Wings\nContents\n1\nBiography\n2\nBroken Wings\n3\nTakeover Bounty\n4\nAppearances\nBiography\nDuring the\nGreen Poison\ncrisis, John was in the Maryland National Guard until it got to merged into the\nJTF\n.
