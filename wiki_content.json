The game was supposed to enter end-of-life stage in 2021 when [[Warlords of New York]]/Year 2 ended with [[End of Watch|Season 4: End of Watch]]. But thanks to player feedback, the dev team was rebuilt to keep supporting the game with new content, starting with [[Hidden Alliance|Season 9: Hidden Alliance]] in May 2022, with an [[Battle for Brooklyn|upcoming DLC]] coming out later in 2025.\n\n==Overview==\nThe events of ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'' take place during the summer of [[Washington, D.C.]], 7 months after the events of the [[Green Poison|Dollar Flu]], which took place\u00a0in the winter in [[New York City]]. The virus has now spread to Washington, D.C. During the initial phase of the crisis, important personnel such as POTUS, Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff and other important politicians were being evacuated. The chaos of the virus began with attacks on the Pentagon, The National Mall and other landmarks. Riots followed the day after and the security forces were hit, forcing them to evacuate the capital. The dense heatwave added to more problems. The supply lines were cut off; after a few days survivors developed communities and many of them were armed, while the criminals have developed their own factions and raid these communities for supply and control. Factions like the [[True Sons]], a group of paramilitary warlords bent on dominating their enemies and expanding their territory around Washington, D.C. These militants are led by a former [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] officer [[Antwon Ridgeway]] who, along with those that follow him, are a force to be reckoned with. Because of this, [[Directive 51]] has been activated in Washington, D.C. and thus activates [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division agents]] who launch a joint operation with the [[Civilian Militia]] in D.C. in order to recapture the capital.\n\nWashington, D.C. has been recreated to be as authentic as possible complete with well-known landmarks and buildings. Despite the possible controversy, Ubisoft has stated that the choice of location was not one of politics despite the fact the chosen location is the nation's capital. <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj7eYn7FKYk]</ref>\u00a0 Combat will be similar to the original game, with a few new features which include new skills and new weapons. Players who help the citizens in D.C. may find some willing to take up arms and join the fight.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Main|Story (The Division 2)}}\n\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several [[Strategic Homeland Division|Strategic Homeland Division (SHD)]] agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and communications, suddenly shuts down and they receive a Division distress call from Washington, D.C. The player\u2019s agent makes their way to the city where The Division and the remains of the local Joint Task Force have set up their Base of Operations in The White House. After defeating an attack on the White House shortly after arriving in the city, the agent is briefed on the general situation by [[Manny Ortega]], The Division controller for D.C. The agent learns that much of the city is under the control of three main enemy factions: the [[Hyenas]], a loosely organized group of several gangs, criminals, and anarchists who seek to take advantage of the chaos, the [[Outcasts]], a fanatical group made up of the survivors of the Roosevelt Island quarantine zone, whom seek to exact revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection, and the [[True Sons]], a highly organized and ruthless group of former Joint Task Force personnel, paramilitaries, and other traitors who seek to gain control over the entire capital. Ortega instructs the agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to help assist civilian settlements, fight the various enemy groups, and restore the SHD Network. Meanwhile, Ortega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of Air Force One and is being held by one of the city's factions. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to rescue Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure.\n\nThe agent continues to work to liberate city districts and eventually manages to find and rescue Ellis from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that a cure to not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exists but he can only access it with a special briefcase he had with him on Air Force One. However, the briefcase is in the possession of the True Sons who are holding it in their main base at the United States Capitol. With the Capitol too fortified to assault yet, the agent works to strengthen The Division's forces while continuing to weaken the other factions. Eventually, the agent is able to restore the SHD Network, connecting all Division agents nationwide, restoring the power and advantages of the Strategic Homeland Division to all agents across the United States. With the tide turning against them, the various factions retreat to their final strongholds - the [[District Union Arena]], [[Roosevelt Island]], and the [[Capitol Building|United States Capitol]]. Victories in each stronghold break the factions up and remove their leadership permanently, leaving the factions disorganized and in disarray.\n\nHowever, as the agent and The Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced private security contractor [[Black Tusk]], invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis goes missing, leaving the agent to head out once again to repel the Black Tusk invasion. During this time, ECHOs reveal that the Black Tusk was responsible for the shutting down of the SHD Network and that they had been planning an invasion long before the agent had arrived, supplying arms to the Hyenas and what not. Similarly, the invasion causes mass chaos in D.C., with formerly liberated areas suddenly becoming hot zones and the settlements coming under threat once again. Despite this, the agent fights through each and every landmark once again, eventually somewhat stabilizing the situation in D.C., and is able to access the Broad-Spectrum Antivirals, apparently hidden in the Ellipse Complex near The White House. It is there that the agent discovers that Ellis had actually handed the Antivirals over to Black Tusk and that they are now being held at [[Tidal Basin|Black Tusk's Tidal Basin Headquarters (in West Potomac Park)]].\n\nFollowing this, the agent launches an ambitious invasion to finally remove the Black Tusk from D.C. by attacking Tidal Basin, as well as recovering the antivirals. The mission nearly ends in disaster, with desperate Black Tusk leadership attempting to launch a missile at The White House, but the agent eventually prevails, recovering the antivirals. Despite this, D.C. remains in total disarray, with four major hostile factions now jostling for power over the city in various different ways, while President and traitor Andrew Ellis remains missing.\n\n==Features==\n*[[Specializations]] - End game content that allows players to continue character and weapon progression with elite weapons and skill trees.

They appear to be bandits who are hostile to anybody they encounter. The driving force behind their hostility and organization is currently unknown, as they are a minor faction within D.C. and not a major threat to the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]]. Encounters with them are random. \n\nThe Ambushers are the only faction who do not use firearms (excluding the \"Hoarder\" archetype), and are equipped only with rudimentary weapons, such as compound bows or fire axes. They wear all-black clothing, climbing gear, bandanas over their faces, and dark shades concealing their eyes. During Christmas time, they also don red Santa Claus hats.\n\nAn Ambusher Rusher briefly appears in the [[ViewPoint Museum]], alongside Staff Sergeant [[Carl Wade|Wade]].\n{{Clear}}\n==Archetypes==\n<tabber> \nRusher=\n{{Template:Class\n|title1  = Ambusher Rusher\n|weapons = Axe}} \n{{Quote|I think I once mentioned that I was glad we chose to take to the rooftops because we'd avoid those crazies living underground.

He appears as the final boss in the final [[Strongholds|Stronghold]], at the [[Capitol Building]].\n\nRidgeway served during the start of the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] in Washington, D.C. and was given the responsibility to administer the quarantine on [[Roosevelt Island]] to make sure everything ran smoothly. When the chaos erupted in the quarantine, he deployed guards to make sure nobody could leave the area. He let people starve to death and withheld medicine from the infected.\n\nRidgeway abused his authority for a long time until the commander of the JTF discovered him and imprisoned Ridgeway for his actions. Once loyal members of his unit freed him, Ridgeway gathered men from his former unit and the stockade where he was held prisoner, they captured JTF officers that had imprisoned him and held a symbolic tribunal for them, only to execute them all moments later.\n\n== Biography ==\nRidgeway was once a top salesman as well as \"weekend warrior\" in the [[Wikipedia:Maryland_Army_National_Guard|Maryland National Guard]]. Having financed his college studies through ROTC he went on to become a reserve officer and his effortless charm and dogged salesman's perseverance won him early favor with his superiors. During his time as a Major (presumably when he was in the Marine Corps), he ordered a fire mission on an insurgent village after his unit recovered his subordinate's body (though the insurgents decapitated his head and displayed it as intimidation tactic). The collateral damage that was caused by his order led him to attend a mandatory counseling session, where he explains the counselor why he made the order in the first place. During that session, he maintained that a belief can be disproven, though it wouldn't be as easy as it takes conviction, commitment, and willpower.\n\nLater on, he got promoted and was commanding a company of the Maryland National Guard as a Colonel when the pandemic struck.\n\nAs the National Guard was assimilated into the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]], he became increasingly disgruntled with how things were run, and led his unit in a rebellion in early February, taking command to form the [[True Sons]] militia. After some infighting amongst the primary instigators, he emerged as the sole and undisputed leader of the True Sons and he has led them ever since, promoting himself to general, as he will never take orders again.\n\n{{Clear}}\n== The creation of the True Sons ==\n{{Quote|There's no room for weakness. Cowards die on their knees. It's gonna be great.|General Antwon Ridgeway}}\nWhen the pandemic broke out, chaos and panic quickly spread across [[Washington, D.C.]] In an attempt to control the spreading of the [[Green Poison|virus]], the newly formed\u00a0[[Joint Task Force|JTF]] established a quarantine on [[Roosevelt Island]], Colonel Antwon Ridgeway formerly of the Maryland National Guard was given the responsibility to enforce the quarantine and ensure that everything ran smoothly. Seeing all the tragedy caused by the virus and how overwhelmed the JTF had become, Ridgeway started to lose faith in his commander's\u00a0ability to save Washington, D.C. He quickly came to the conclusion that there needed to be drastic actions taken to ensure their survival.\n\nAs a strong believer in the need for proper authority and discipline, Ridgeway decided to take matters into his own hands. In frustration and fear for the city's future, he ordered his guards around the quarantine to bar the entrances and exits and not let anyone in or out even the medical staff\u00a0attending to the sick. He started to redirect essential resources from going into\u00a0the quarantine, letting people starve to death and withholding medicine. In his eyes, the sick and the weak were already dead, so his number one priority became to secure the future of his own men. When confronted by a [[CERA]] doctor that\u00a0she would report Ridgeway's actions to his superiors, he murdered the doctor right in front of terrified\u00a0civilians. He then ruthlessly ordered his men to put down any resistance from inside the quarantine.\n\nRidgeway's actions were tainted by his willingness to do whatever it took for the well-being of his soldiers and his repulsion of the sick. Due to the chaotic state of the city, he was able to abuse his authority for a long time before the commander of the JTF found out and dispatched a [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agent\u00a0to investigate. This led to a confrontation at the CERA Constitution Camp where the Division agent witnessed Colonel Ridgeway murder a civilian for breaking quarantine, this led the agent into\u00a0shooting one of Ridgeway's unit and\u00a0place Ridgeway under arrest on\u00a055 counts of murder. He was then court-martialed\u00a0along with several officers of his unit and found guilty on all counts and imprisoned in the [[American History Museum]] JTF stockade. However, it did not take long until\u00a0Captain [[Keates]] and Major [[Ashford]], two loyal members of Ridgeway's\u00a0unit seeing the JTF's\u00a0actions as a betrayal, broke into the stockade with Corporal Masters and Staff Sergeant [[Greystoke]] and freed him.\n\nIn Ridgeway's eyes, he had done nothing wrong. According to him, he was the only one with a realistic and viable solution to the situation. Therefore, the betrayal of his fellow JTF officers and imprisonment filled him with rage and hate towards the JTF and the federal government. As soon as he got out, he gathered men from his former unit and the stockade where he was held, prisoner. Together they captured the JTF officers that had imprisoned him and held a symbolic tribunal for them, only to execute them all moments later \u2013 and so the [[True Sons]] were born.\n\nRidgeway also gave the order to Captain [[Wilson]] to decimate the [[Castle Settlement]] with weaponized [[DC-62]] mortars, killing its citizens and ruining the settlement with DC-62 chemicals for a little while as punishment for the settlement's defiance against the True Sons.\n\n\n== Standing the ground ==\n{{Quote|This world, the new world, is for those willing to work for it. Fight for it. Stand their ground, regardless of the cost. Even if it means being hated. Even if it means being at war the rest of your days. |General Antwon Ridgeway}}But justice would soon come to Ridgeway as [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents came to [[Washington, D.C.]] not only to restore their [[SHD Network]] but take back the city from its brink. One by one, the [[True Sons]] lost their territories as well their operations in D.C. Underestimating the Division, he ordered to throw more of his True Sons against them. Despite a protest from one of his strategists about the loss of soldiers, he maintained that order as losing control is less acceptable to him than losing soldiers.\n\nRidgeway was in the [[Capitol Building]] when the Division and their allies assaulted it to extract [[President Ellis]]' briefcase. Despite an attempt to prevent this via SAM launchers, the agents managed to extract the briefcase. Ridgeway made his stand against the agents alongside his forces, but he'd be killed not long after.\n\nHis death effectively scattered the True Sons as they found themselves disorganized and at war with every faction in the city.\n\n\n== Ridgeway's Legacy ==\n{{Quote|I will finish what Ridgeway started, no matter the cost.|Colonel Morozova}}In the wake of Ridgeway's death, many [[True Sons]] units attempted to continue his legacy and finish what he started. One unit led by [[Morozova|Colonel Morozova]] took over the [[Operation Iron Horse|United Ironworks]] facility, hoping to use the Iron Horse train to decimate the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] and take over [[Washington, D.C.|D.C]]. But that never came to be as a team of eight agents assaulted the facility, destroyed the Iron Horse, and killed Morozova.\n\nA few months later, the True Sons would have a resurgence under the command of [[General Anderson|General Peter Anderson]], who formerly worked as a strategist for Ridgeway. He sent a unit led by [[Captain Lewis|Captain Frederick Lewis]] to D.C as a [[Hidden Alliance|\"homecoming party\"]]. However, the Division clashed against Lewis' unit, eventually fighting with the Captain against [[Black Tusk]] forces in [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center]].\n\nRealizing that his troops are no match for the Division, Anderson decided to rebuild the alliance with Black Tusk. This didn't set well with Captain Lewis nor with [[Candice Wallace|Candice \"Wally\" Wallace]] as they went to aid the Division in preventing this by eliminating Anderson's lieutenants as well as the general. Sadly, the general managed to escape his assassination attempt when Division agents went to [[Pentco Fairview Power Plant (Manhunt: General Anderson)|Pentco Fairview]] to rescue Captain Lewis. Meanwhile, Anderson got aboard a Black Tusk hovercraft, officially re-establishing the alliance with Black Tusk.\n\nDuring a counseling session Wally had with [[Mitchell Billings|Doctor Mitchell Billings]], she felt that General Ridgeway's vision was about saving Washington, D.C despite the atrocities he committed. On the other hand, General Anderson doesn't care for the future of the True Sons and is only it for power. In other words, by allying his True Sons with Black Tusk, Anderson sullied Ridgeway's legacy.\n\n\n== Personality ==\n{{Quote|I give you an order. You follow it, or you don't. But don't think for a goddamn second that I won't have your ass strung up for disobeying it.|General Antwon Ridgeway}}\nRidgeway is ambitious and has a strong desire to lead. He will always dominate the conversation and express his concerns if he disagrees with the people. He can become decisive when under intense pressure. He is extremely aggressive as the leader of the [[True Sons]] and wants to achieve victory at any cost.\n\nDuring his time with the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]], Ridgeway was likely dutiful and possessed competent leadership and planning skills as he achieved the rank of Colonel and was tasked with administrating the quarantine on [[Roosevelt Island]]. During the quarantine chaos, Antwon demonstrated to be quite cold as he prioritized the safety of his men over the infected and allowed them to die. Conversely, he can be caring and charismatic to his men as some of his soldiers defended his actions during his arrest.\n\nHe can tolerate those who question his priorities as he can easily persuade them into agreeing with him. However, Ridgeway will not tolerate insubordination, and worse, desertion, and will personally execute those who try.\n\nRidgeway seems to have established a cult of personality within his faction as he self-promoted himself as a General and has the fierce loyalty of those under his command. He also views himself and the True Sons as the only hope in restoring order in [[Washington, D.C.]] and thus justifies the act of demanding tribute from other settlements. He and his men believe it's mutually beneficial as the settlements get protection in exchange the True Sons get supplies despite some settlements wanting nothing to do with the faction or believing the demands as too harsh.\n\nConsequently, Ridgeway considers those who offer tribute (willing or by force) to be considered, by default, part of the True Sons and thus as his \"citizen\" he expects them to obey. A phone recording between him and a random civilian showed him intimidating the civilian into handing over his supplies by indirectly threatening him by mentioning the civilian's neighbor was \"not a good citizen\" and was dealt with.\n\nThroughout the conversation, while Ridgeway clearly intimidated the man, he treated the civilian nicely by calling him a \"good and model citizen\" and that he was doing his part by contributing to the True Sons but nonetheless told the civilian that he expects more supplies to be handed over the following week.\n\nAs the True Sons started to lose more men and territory to [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]], Ridgeway became incredibly more impatient and egotistical, ordering a large counter-offensive while they still had the chance. Although a True Sons' Strategist advised there would be heavy casualties, Ridgeway retorted that they would either lose men, or lose control. \n\nRidgeway had some level of respect for the Division during a drunken stupor, as he believed the Division understood they were fighting a war while  the JTF were too busy trying to police a civilian population while chaos engulfed the city. His hatred of JTF officers goes deep as they weren't in the field and hiding in bunkers, giving orders that gotten their people killed, and even going as far as saying \"firing squad were too good for these cowards\".\n\nRidgeway has even developed hypocritical and delusional beliefs, as an [[ECHO]] shows him executing True Sons Deserters and talks about loyalty which has some irony in it because he went rogue from the JTF, he talks of hordes of degenerates, yet it was because of him that the Outcasts exists because of what he did at Roosevelt Island and mentioning the corruption in government shows he is the corruption as he went AWOL.\n\nRidgeway is a strong believer in discipline and authority, talking harshly and brooking no insubordination.\n\n\n== Abilities ==\n{{Quote|I\u2019ve been shot plenty of times, Never once it has been enough gun to get the job done.| General Antwon Ridgeway}}\nColonel Antwon Ridgeway is the final boss of The [[Capitol Building |Capitol Building Stronghold]]. He is a unique Heavy Weapons Unit armed with a [[M60/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Military M60 E4]], [[Carl Gustav M3 RPG|Carl Gustav RPG]], and [[M9|M9 pistol]]. He also possesses an armored helmet and [[Black Tusk]] medical drones that revive fallen [[True Sons]], similar to a Black Tusk Medic.\n\nHe usually lays suppressive fire on the agents to stop them moving, though he often switches to the Carl Gustav to knock the agent out of cover. His weakness is the ammo box on the back of his waist, which if shot will set off a spray of bullets, distracting him and making him a prime target for about 20 seconds. If this is shot he will then act as an elite RPG, using his pistol and Carl Gustav.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n*Despite being listed as a National Guard, he may have also previously served in the U.S. Marines, as he wears a coat that resembles Marine dress blues. The same goes for his [[True Sons]], who all have elements of Marine Uniforms in their outfits. \n**This is the further evidenced from Profile: Antwon Ridgeway comms as two of those comms involved him in a mandatory counseling session when he was a Major.\n*He also possessed the [[Liberty|Liberty Exotic Pistol]] at some time.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nRidgeway gear.png\nRidgeway face.png\n</gallery>\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Enemies]]\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:True Sons]]",
  "Armor Plates": "'''Armor Plates''' (later known as '''Armor Kits''') are pieces of [[SHD Tech|SHD Technology]] used by the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division agents]] during their activities in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Lower Manhattan]], during the events of [[Tom Clancy's The Division 2|''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'']] and [[Warlords of New York]]. They replace the [[Medkit|Medkits]] from the [[Tom Clancy's The Division|first game]].\n\n== Functionality ==\nArmor Plates are used by agents to regenerate their armor, when their armor take sufficient damage or has been completely destroyed. Depending on the Specialization an Agent has activated when they reach endgame, armor plates can provide temporary bonuses after use and have different abilities.  \n\n== Variants ==\nThere are nine different variants of Armor Plates: six of them connected to a [[Specializations|Specialization]], one of them being a Gear Set talent.   \n\n=== Standard Armor Kit ===\nThe base variant that all Division agents start off with. It recovers all of the health and armor of an agent after use with no after-affect bonuses. This is also the only armor kit that is accessible to [[Factions/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|hostile factions]].\n\n=== Instant Armor Kit ===\nA subvariant of the Standard Armor Kit that is available to all Division agents. After use, Agents gain 20% of their armor back. It has a 2 second cooldown and requires the player to double tap the Armor Kit button to use. Instant Armor Kits do not have any after-effect bonuses, even if the Agent has a specialization activated. \n\n=== Distributed Repair Kit ===\n[[File:Screenshot 20190130-231425-1.png|thumb|220x220px|The Survivalist putting on a new armor plate]]\nThe variant that is unique to the [[Survivalist (Specialization)|Survivalist]] specialization. After use, the armor bar will be repaired over 5 seconds instead of instantly, even if the agent is being shot at; armor heal will also be applied to group members that are within 10 meters of the agent.\n\n=== Stimulant Patch Kit ===\n[[File:Screenshot 20190130-233512.png|thumb|220x220px|The Demolitionist putting on a new armor plate]]\nThe variant that is unique to the [[Demolitionist (Specialization)|Demolitionist]] specialization. After use, the agent will gain back 100% of their armor and weapon handling will be boosted by 30% for 15 seconds.\n\n=== Emergency Cleanse Kit ===\n[[File:Screenshot 20190130-230816.png|thumb|220x220px|The Sharpshooter's armor plate shown at E3 2018]]\nThe variant that is unique to the [[Sharpshooter (Specialization)|Sharpshooter]] specialization. After use, the agent will get back 100% of their armor; moreover, the use of the Sharpshooter Armor Plate will also remove any status effect that agent is being affected by, as well as increase resistance to Bleed, Poison and Burn for 20 seconds.                               \n\n=== Hardened Armor Kit ===\nThe variant that is unique to the [[Gunner (Specialization)|Gunner]] specialization. After use, agents will recover 100% of their armor, plus have an additional 30% bonus armor for 10 seconds.  \n\n=== Emergency Patch Kit ===\nThe variant that is unique to the [[Technician (Specialization)|Technician]] specialization. After use, healing done from the armor kit also applies to friendly skills that are within 10 meters to the agent. \n\n=== Extracellular Matrix Mesh Kit ===\nThe variant that is unique to the [[Firewall (Specialization)|Firewall]] specialization. After use, the agent will gain back 200% armor and 200% health overtime for 10 seconds.\n\n=== Hackstep Protocol Ability ===\nThe Hackstep Protocol is the talent exclusive to the System Corruption [[Gear Sets|Gear Set]]. The Hackstep Protocol is infinite and gives 20% armor repair while providing 50% bonus armor; in addition, using the Hackstep Protocol hides the agent's nameplate upon use and increases weapon damage. The Hackstep Protocol bonuses last for 5 seconds and the ability has a 20 second cooldown per use.   \n\n== Differences between Medkits and Armor Kits ==\nWhile both the medkit and Armor Kit have the same role (recover health to the agent) they work differently. \n* Armor Plates recover all armor and health; medkits only recover two-thirds of an agent's health.\n* Armor Plates require players to hold down the button down for 2 seconds to receive the full after-effects of the kit; medkits provide instant healing and after-effects (which The Division community termed as \"popping a medkit\").\n* Medkits cure the agents from [[Status Effect|status effects]]; only the Sharpshooter's Armor Plate has this ability.\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Equipment]]\n[[Category:SHD Tech]]",

In the months since the Green Poison outbreak, Brooklyn had some relative peace as civilians huddled up there to avoid the chaos happening in Manhattan, and built up a settlement to sustain and defend themselves.\n\nHowever, that peace has been interrupted by the arrival of Cleaners, where they attacked Brooklyn with enhanced flamethrowers that burn purple flames. Their goal, is to cleanse Brooklyn with fire, regardless of the collateral damage and lives lost. And to make things worse, Rikers have arrived as well, which makes life for the civilians all the more harder.\n\nAnd it is up to Division agents to stop the hostiles and save Brooklyn.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* [[Theo Parnell]] - A core member of Aaron Keener's team of Rogue Agents and a key figure in integrating [[ANNA]] to their plans.\n* [[Jessica Kandel]] - A virologist who was on the front-lines during the Green Poison outbreak and a key-figure to developing the first prototypes for the BSAV. A lot of time had passed, and not only her ID badge had seen better days.\n* [[Melanie Hoskins]] - First featured in the audio drama, ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Hearts on Fire|Hearts on Fire]].'' First Wave Agent who was in New York during the early months of the crisis, then later joined Aaron Keener and had since become a key figure in his operation\n\n== Activities and Features ==\n\n* 3 Main Missions. \n** They all take place off-site for greater freedom in mission design\n*New Season: Fall / Autumn\n**Players can experience navigating post-pandemic Brooklyn in the Fall season, to show the passage of time and emphasize how much has changed since the first time they were there.\n*Two named Zones: Brooklyn Heights and Dumbo.\n*New Settlement: The Bridge\n* 4 World Missions. \n** These are basically side-missions where players can replay them at their own leisure.\n* 4 Control Points.\n** Those control points change behavior depending on the faction.

For example, adding a new wrapper to open world activities that reacts to player's actions while going around to earn their loot. Not only that, they're focusing on the Economy with a package of revamps for more depth to the endgame's progression, giving players more control of tinkering and item customization.\n\n=== Holistic Season Experience ===\nFor Year 7's Seasons, their aim is to make them more holistic by realigning the modifiers, gear, and gameplay with the narrative elements which are the Manhunts and their Climax Missions. In addition to seasonal events, players can look forward to new features like \"Weapon Stats\" or \"Resource Boosts\", though further details on those are yet to be given.\n\n== Plot ==\n''NOTICE: Spoilers ahead. Read at your own discretion''\n\nAt the White House, D.C Division agents would receive a distress call from Agent [[Melanie Hoskins]], asked for help in Brooklyn. As they travel via helicopter with [[Casey Bell]] as their pilot. They reach Brooklyn to the [[One Police Plaza]], where they find it under attack by the Cleaners. The hostiles killed Kandel's security detail, but the agents eliminated them alongside their commander [[Healy]] and managed to rescue Kandel. With the Cleaners dealt with, they reached The Bridge Settlement.\n\nHowever, things aren't as easy as it seems. The Cleaners are using a new accelerant where it burns purple flames, capable of causing corrosion towards foot-mobile's armor or even turret defenses.\n\n=== [[CERA Clinic]] ===\nNot soon after the agents arrived, they're informed by Hoskins that the CERA Clinic was under attack by the Cleaners. With the Clinic having equipment for intense medical procedures, the agents immediately head there to secure it. Sadly, the Cleaners have killed all the personnel in the clinic. To avenge the dead, the agents eliminated the Cleaners responsible, including [[Stewart]], a high-ranking Cleaner member.\n\nDespite the loss of the Clinic, the Bridge managed to secure the supplies and equipment to care for the sick. \n\nIn addition, the Division learn of [[Richard Danvers]], who seems to be leading the Cleaners. With that in mind, Hoskins coordinates with the agents to find and eliminate Danvers.\n\n=== [[DUMBO Skate Park|Dumbo Skate Park]] ===\nThanks to intel gathered from Cleaner's radios during the CERA Clinic attack, the Division learned of their base settled in Dumbo Skate Park. Fighting through the park, the agents gathered intel from a laptop on the rooftop, then pushed through where they fought against [[Hollings]], another high-ranking Cleaner member. \n\nWith the Park secured, they recovered a footage where it showed [[Matthew Grant]], a former SFX Artist turned into one of the Cleaner higher-ups are using tech from the Descent simulation program to create a deepfake of Aaron Keener killing a civilian and acting like a megalomaniac.\n\nThe fact that the Cleaners have an SFX artist to create deepfakes of the Rogues to make them sound and look like lunatics didn't sit well with Agent Hoskins. Additionally, Hoskins called in a few favors to find a good lead against the Cleaners.\n\n=== [[H5 Refinery]] ===\nAgent Hoskins found a lead on where the Cleaners are producing the purple flame, in the H5 Refinery, off of Brooklyn. JTF Pilot Casey Bell takes the agents to the refinery, where they fight against many Cleaners and their defenses\n\nHalf-way through the attack, however, Hoskins shouted her frustrations against the Cleaners (due to past trauma over her dead sister and the faction's atrocities), so she was forced to take a break and let Jessica Kandel take over as mission control. \n\nAs the agents disrupted Danvers's operation in the refinery, they face against an experimental Warhound dubbed [[Violet (Warhound)|Violet]] that was deployed by a Cleaner Commander, [[Jasinski]], to stop them. The Warhound was no match for the agents, as they destroyed it. By then, Jasinski activates the Refinery's self-destruct sequence. Worse, Hoskins informs the agents that The Bridge is under attack by Rikers. Under Kandel's encouragement, the agents tried to stabilize the refinery through pressure valves, and eliminating Jasinski in the process.\n\nTheir efforts to save the refinery were in vain, as they were forced to abandon it, and head to Brooklyn immediately to support The Bridge. The Refinery itself was destroyed.\n\n=== Riker attack on The Bridge ===\nUnder Danvers' orders, The Rat Queen and her Rikers attacked The Bridge. With the settlement's defenses compromised, the Rikers were gaining the upper hand. But the D.C agents pushed, eliminating any Riker in their way. Despite efforts to stall the agents, Danvers ordered Rat Queen and her forces to fall back.\n\nWith the Rikers pushed back, The Bridge was saved, albeit with some casualties.\n\nImmediately after, Theo Parnell arrived to The Bridge to help the agents and the settlement. Hoskins wasn't happy for his late arrival, even when Parnell explained that he had to convince Manny Ortega to let him go to Brooklyn.\n\nWith Theo's help, he activates a friendly Marauder dubbed \"Viper\", synced to the Rogue Network, to help the agents in disrupting the Rikers operation in Brooklyn Heights. Their first two leads: Clarke Street and Bridge Park Pier.\n\n=== [[Clarke Street]] and [[Bridge Park Pier]] ===\nStarting with Clarke Street Hotel and with Theo Parnell's coordination, Division agents fought through the Rikers where they managed to rescue the civilians who were taken hostage. When that was done, they went underground for their real objective; The subway depot. After much fighting, the agents secured the depot as well as the supplies\n\nLater on, Parnell coordinated with the agents for their mission to secure Bridge Park Pier from the Rikers. Parnell has his Marauder Drone help out the agents in taking out at least one of the SAM launchers. Unfortunately, the Marauder sustained some damage and was forced to leave for some repairs.\n\nEventually, the agents disabled all the launchers after much fighting. With both Clarke Street and the Pier secured, they secured a foothold on Brooklyn Heights. And a good lead on the Rat Queen.\n\n=== [[The Art Museum]] ===\nWith the lead on Rat Queen connecting her to The Art Museum, Parnell coordinated with the Division agents to go there and eliminate her. They fight through Riker personnel and defenses, as well as a few lieutenants. However, before confronting the Queen, the agents discover an ECHO which reveals Rat Queen's true identity: Sarah Moretti.\n\nAfter her husband and daughter were killed by the Rikers, Sarah took revenge on the Riker responsible and took leadership, then faked her death with help from Danvers and Grant.\n\nThis shook Parnell completely, then implored the agents to instead apprehend Sarah instead. The Division then confronted Rat Queen, though she'd disappear and were forced to deal with her two bodyguards\n\nThe agents then catch up to Sarah on the rooftops, where she was using an electronic shield protecting her from incoming projectiles, as well as being supported by other Rikers. During the fight, the agents powered up the generators while dealing with Riker forces, then managed to temporarily disable Sarah's shield. By the second time, her shield was permanently disabled, and the agents managed to wound her enough to be apprehended.\n\nWith Sarah Moretti dealt with, a few Bridge members came in to stabilize her due to wounds she sustained, then sent to the settlement for interogation. Division agents would follow after and return to The Bridge for debrief.\n\nWhile Theo is still frustrated with Sarah going turncoat, Hoskins' interrogation did produce results as she revealed Danvers' location at the Army Terminal. Despite no guarantee he's there, Parnell and Hoskins coordinates the agents to assault the place and make Danvers pay.\n\n=== [[Army Terminal]] ===\nDivision agents assault the Army Terminal compound, where they took down Cleaner forces and their defenses from the entrance. As Danvers was heard on enemy comms, the Division was one step closer to taking him down. However, as the agents move deeper into the lab, they'd find a secret Black Tusk stronghold as well as dealing with their soldiers defending it. \n\nIt turns out that Black Tusk was the mastermind behind the recent events in Brooklyn, as the Site is used for R&D of experimental tech using the Purple Flame, which included Flamer Warhounds equipped with the accelerant.\n\nNevertheless, the agents sweeped deeper into the complex, eliminating the hostiles securing a small modular reactor that was powering up the Site. During their sweep, Danvers taunted the agents, trying to convince them that Keener's Rogues aren't worth it, as well as taunting them that they've been with good people for a long time that they don't know what a 'Snake\" looks like.\n\nAs the Division reached the rooftop, they'd discover Black Tusk has a massive armored Zeppelin, and it lifted off when Danvers and some of his crew boarded it. Moreover, the Zeppelin was equipped with Purple Flame bombs and Razorback drone launchers, ready to unleash hell on The Bridge settlement.\n\nNot wasting time, the agents got to work by hacking the SAM launchers with ANNA's help. In a desperate attempt, Danvers launched the LM-21 Marauder, equipped with a laser and missile launchers to stop them. But even the Marauder was no match, as it was destroyed. With the SAM launchers under their control, the agents launch the missiles, severely damaging the Zeppelin enough to crash into the ground. With the Zeppelin destroyed, Richard Danvers was killed, which\n\n=== Revelations ===\nHowever, there was more to uncover as Division agents uncovered a third found footage video after Richard Danvers was eliminated. In that footage, it showed Sarah Moretti and Danvers giving him a Rogue SHD Tech crate to use for the Cleaners operation on Meret Estate. When asked if she managed to get Gordon Amherst's [[3D printer]], Sarah admitted she couldn't as it was held in a vault and the only person with the key was Dr. Kandel.\n\nWhen the agents return to The Bridge for debrief on the underground compound, Agent Hoskins confront Theo Parnell over the fact that Keener and his Rogues kept Amherst's 3D printer with them in the vault, as well as the fact that Parnell gave the vault key to Hoskins without telling her why. \n\nParnell explains that the printer is a leverage, but Hoskins believes that printer is too much of a risk and puts a target on The Bridge, though Parnell argues they always have a target on their backs, so might use. On the other hand, Kandel made her position clear; If the printer is used for anything besides making vaccines or medical research, she's leaving.\n\nRegardless, Hoskins is angry over the printer being kept and storms out.\n\nGiven this context, it becomes clear that Black Tusk's mission on Brooklyn was to take Amherst's printer. Given that printer itself was once used by Gordon Amherst to create the Green Poison as well as Keener used it to create the Eclipse, Black Tusk would've been able to create a bioweapon with that printer. And with the [[Perfusion Bioreactor]] in their hands (after they stole it from the White House during their assault), they would've been able to have a huge leverage against the rebuilding settlements across America. \n\nStill, with the truth about Amherst's Printer still ongoing, it's only a matter of time.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:BattleforBrooklyn.jpeg\nFile:BattleForBrooklyn concept.jpg\nFile:BattleforBrooklynart.jpeg\nFile:Div2 BFB1.jpg\nFile:Div2 BFB2.jpg\nFile:Div2 BFB3.jpg\nFile:Div2 BFB4.webp\n</gallery>\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Expansions]]\n[[Category:Patches and Updates]]\n[[Category:Downloadable Content in The Division 2]]",

Operating as a large Private Military Company with ties to the U.S. government, the B.T.S.U. invaded [[Washington, D.C.]] shortly after the [[True Sons]] were pushed out of the [[Capitol Building]].\n\nThe Black Tusks took back the former faction Strongholds and mission locations. Although when [[Tidal Basin]], the Black Tusks' main Stronghold was secured by [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]], they still operate in D.C., securing other landmarks and locations. \n\nAs an endgame faction, the Black Tusk only appears once the player has completed all the [[Story]] missions and [[Strongholds]] during their level 1 - 30 experience. They also share similarities with the [[Last Man Battalion]] and [[Hunters]] from ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]].''\n\n== Background ==\nThe mysterious Black Tusk faction is [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division's]] most recently established nemesis, one that is still imperfectly understood. Known as a highly trained, well-equipped, and brutally efficient special operations unit, the Black Tusk appear to be seeking control of the United States federal government. But unlike other factions in both [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] who share the same goal, the Black Tusk seem to have high-level backing. They have unlimited funding support, eerily precise Intel, and access to remarkably advanced and even experimental technology.\n\nReports coming into Division headquarters suggest that under cover of the [[Green Poison]] pandemic's spreading disruption, Black Tusk operations have already secured key strategic locations around the country: military bases, power-grid and utilities infrastructure, media-communications hubs, Internet server farms, certain financial institutions and high-tech corporate campuses, and so on. Now it appears they've been called to Washington, D.C. to neutralize federal resistance and counter The Division activations mandated by [[Directive 51|Presidential Directive 51]]. \n\nAlthough its exact origins remain shrouded in mystery and what looks like deliberate misinformation, the Black Tusk group is comprised of both military and paramilitary units with a long history of working for shadowy elements of the United States government in conflict zones around the world. Black Tusk operatives have been active in everything from covert regime-change operations to on-the-ground counterinsurgency efforts in a wide array of hot spots in Latin America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and North Africa. \n\nThe group's current configuration is clearly recruited in direct response to the bioterror attack last December. Black Tusk units and equipment began shipping back to the United States in the very early hours of the outbreak - indeed, before the full extent of the crisis was even known, which suggests the disturbing possibility of fore-knowledge. Intel intercepts since indicate a desire to \"cleanse, pacify, and police the emerging New America\".\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Intelligence Brief ==\nThe Black Tusk are extremely well equipped, supported by cutting-edge field technologies and military-grade spec-ops vehicles that can deploy troops rapidly anywhere: land, sea, or air. The group features a large force of veteran operatives with extensive experience in conflict zones, including some of the hottest hotspots in the world. And they have a very targeted set of goals:\n*Eliminate all hostile factions and groups in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n*Ruthlessly suppress civil unrest.\n*Disarm and control the [[settlements]].\n*Neutralize the [[Strategic Homeland Division]] and any armed forces allied to it.\n\nAlthough the Black Tusk group is a private military company, it is not strictly work-for-hire like other companies of mercenary soldiers. Black Tusk are ideologically driven as well. They operate based on their chilling vision of a new world order, and they fervently believe in their role as the harbingers and military guardians of that order.\n\nBelief in their vision's purity lets the Black Tusk terminate anything that threatens it - U.S. soldiers, national security operatives (like The Division), civil servants, civilians - without hesitation or remorse. Men, women, children, the elderly... nobody is an innocent bystander according to Black Tusk rules of engagement. \n\n\n== Relationship with other factions ==\nPrior to their invasion, the Black Tusk monitored and kept tabs on all the warring factions in [[Washington, D.C.]], especially [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]]. Only after all other factions were defeated in their strongholds, did they make their move to invade, facing little resistance.\n\nOne of the Black Tusk's objectives was to sabotage and eliminate The Division and their operations. Several [[ECHO]]'s scattered across D.C. reveal that the B.T.S.U. led by [[Bardon Schaeffer]] has monitored Division agents' activities, sabotaged their [[SHD Network]], and captured/killed several agents all while remaining undetected by every faction. \u00a0\n\nDespite this, Black Tusk holds some level of interest in The Division as they likely scaled back on their sabotage when The Division began to gain momentum against the other factions eventually defeating them. This was most likely done so that all the factions would be weakened in the fighting, allowing for a much smoother and easier Black Tusk invasion.\n\nOne ECHO's reveals that two B.T.S.U. operatives, [[Elijah Sumner]] and [[Jack Bonney]], hold some level of respect for Division agents. They describe fighting them as invigorating and compared it to fighting a team of superheroes. \u00a0\n\nBlack Tusk does not kill civilians, but if they encountered a civilian that works with The Division and the JTF, they will kill them. \u00a0\n\nBefore their invasion in Washington, D.C., they considered the [[Hyenas]] as a low threat and supplied the Hyenas with supplies, just to keep to other factions busy and keep their numbers in check. \u00a0\n\nThere are some incidents where some skirmish took place between True Sons and Black Tusk.\n\nThey also appear to hold some interest in the [[True Sons]] as they have also adopted their strategy of weaponizing the chemical [[DC-62]]. \u00a0\n\nDespite all the factions fighting each other for control of positions within D.C., none have bothered to take back their stronghold from the Black Tusk nor attack their [[Tidal Basin|beachhead]], being too weak and powerless to do so. \u00a0\n\nIn New York, the Black Tusk is revealed to be supplying the [[Last Man Battalion]] with Carl Gustav's and other heavy armaments as shown in the comic ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis]]''.\n\nWhen [[Sueko \"Wraith\" Tanagi|Wraith]] came from hiding, it was revealed that a global corporation hired Black Tusk. As [[Felix \"Kestrel\" Sokolov|Kestrel]] got out of hiding, it was also discovered that Black Tusk was founded by [[Natalya Sokolova]] who allegedly used her family's fortune as a vehicle to dismantle the old government and replace it with that of Black Tusk. Only time will tell how Black Tusk's plot will unravel.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nBlack Tusk is the last major enemy faction that the player encounters, only appearing once the player has reached Level 30 and defeated the [[True Sons]] at their Stronghold in the [[Capitol Building]]. Once they are introduced to the game, they gain control of every Stronghold and most of the Story Missions.\n\nEach area of the map that contains a Black Tusk stronghold will be marked in red as an \"invaded\" segment. The player must replay each of the Strongholds and Missions against Black Tusk; once all these have been completed, the invaded sections of the map will be restored to normal.\n\nSections of [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] that are under the Black Tusk invasion will house Black Tusk activities, such as Public Executions and Territory Control. However, Black Tusk cannot capture [[Control Points]]. After the Black Tusk appears in the game, randomized patrols of Black Tusk troops in the streets of D.C. become common, even in non-invaded sections of the map.\n\nIn combat, Black Tusk troops are heavily reliant on their abilities; they will deploy various types of drones, including aerial Seeker Drones that explode when near the player. Black Tusk troops also favor firing from cover and behave more cautiously than [[Hyenas]] or [[Outcasts]], generally keeping a safe distance from the player. Black Tusk is also distinct from the other factions in that they employ autonomous robots against the player. The Warhound is a quadrupedal, heavily-armored robot with a large-caliber gun that can inflict high damage on the player, but it is slow-moving and its gun has to charge before it fires.\n\nThe UGV is a tracked weapons platform with a machine gun and grenade launcher that can be disabled by shooting its treads or destroyed by killing its Controller operator. Most Black Tusk troops have a distinct weak point, highlighted in red, usually located on either on their back or thigh, which can be targeted by the player to cause explosive or effect damage to the victim. During some missions, they fast-rope to the ground when leaving one of their UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.\n\n\n== Named Members ==\n{{Black Tusk HVT}}\n\n\n== Weapons Used ==\n{{Black Tusk Weapons}}\n\n{{Black Tusk Class}}\n\n\n== Events of Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ==\nShortly after the outbreak hit [[New York City]], Black Tusk was hired by an unknown\u00a0organization to pave the way for a \"new dynasty\". This included orders to dismantle and eliminate any functioning order of the U.S. government, including the [[Strategic Homeland Division]].\n\nA small but elite unit known as the Black Tusk Specialist Unit (B.T.S.U.), led by [[Bardon Schaeffer]], was assembled to infiltrate the city and specifically target The Division and succeeded in killing and capturing a few [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] agents before sabotaging the [[SHD Network]], leading [[Manny Ortega]] to recall agents across the United States\u00a0to Washington, D.C. The B.T.S.U. planned to hunt down the surviving agents but were abruptly called off by their client, who came to believe The Division could become allies to their plan. The Black Tusk is also responsible for the death of (then)\u00a0President of the United States\u00a0[[President Mendez|Thomas Mendez]] as Bardon convinced two secret service agents to kill him and frame his death as a suicide. This was done to further destabilize the U.S. government.\n\n=== Invasion/Operation Dark Hours ===\nAfter The Division destroyed the strongholds of the three major factions in D.C., Black Tusk was sent in to take full advantage of the situation and forcibly seize control of the city while the factions were weakened. Launching a full-scale invasion of the capital, they gained control of the faction strongholds at the [[District Union Arena]], [[Roosevelt Island]], and the [[Capitol Building]]. They also dispatched units across D.C. to\u00a0certain locations and attempted to hack and sabotage\u00a0the SHD Network for a second time to cripple The Division.\n\nAn [[ECHO]] later incriminated [[President Ellis]] in handing over the [[Broad-Spectrum Antiviral]] to the B.T.S.U. in an attempt to extract it through their base at [[Tidal Basin]], betraying both the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] and The Division. However, The Division launched an all-out assault on their Tidal Basin Stronghold and recovered the Antiviral, while eliminating B.T.S.U. operative [[Milla \"Wyvern\" Radek]] as she attempted to launch a missile at [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House.]]\n\nSoon after their defeat in D.C., Black Tusk then took over the [[Washington National Airport]] to coordinate their operations. The Division dispatched their agents to stop them and take it back, after defeating several high ranking operators; Black Tusk was ultimately defeated when The Division destroyed the [[DDP-52 Razorback]], a dangerous drone platform, and recaptured the airport.\n\n=== D.C Outskirts ===\nWhile The Division and [[JTF]] were conducting operations in the outskirts of Washington, D.C., Black Tusk was found securing [[Camp White Oak]]. Quickly launching an attack\u00a0at the camp in a Division-JTF joint operation,\u00a0Black Tusk personnel\u00a0desperately try\u00a0to hold them off.\u00a0It was  confirmed that\u00a0[[Ellis Galveston]], a member of Bardon Schaeffer's B.T.S.U. Team was\u00a0guarding President Ellis at the compound, dubbed \"Chickenhawk\"; during the attack, a helicopter was scrambled\u00a0to evacuate him.\n\nDespite the best efforts from Division agents, President Ellis escaped\u00a0in the helicopter, but they managed to eliminate Galveston and secured Camp White Oak.\n\nIn an attempt to stop the JTF from acquiring data and information in [[Camp White Oak (Invaded)|Camp White Oak]], they staged an offensive and took down the JTF troops stationed there. However, the Division agents turned the tables on them and stopped the offensive. Including killing the officers who were part of Bardon's \"rebuilt\" unit: [[Riley \"Knife\" Carter]], [[Zach \"Loot\" Miller]], and the twin Sniper sisters, [[Teagan \"Tails\" Price]] and [[Harper \"Heads\" Price]]. In frustration, Bardon called his boss, telling him to stop sending clowns to rebuild the unit.\n\n=== The Last Castle ===\nWhen surveillance footage of Black Tusk making their move on [[The Pentagon]] was sent to The Division, the agents took action and breached their defenses. Throughout their assault, Division agents managed to stop Black Tusk in digging further into the Pentagon and stop them from extracting the perfusion reactor, killing dozens of Black Tusk officers, including [[Petrus Brenner]] in the process.\n\nWith the perfusion reactor in The Division's hands, Black Tusk suffered a major setback. Their invasion on [[Manning National Zoo (Invaded)|Manning National Zoo]] reveals the scars left by their war with The Division, as they were using the zoo as proving grounds to recruit new staff from their less experienced reserve after losing much of their elite forces in failed operations.\n\nCatching wind of the recruitment event, Division agents wiped out all recruitment participants on-site (including all Black Tusk assets the PMC might've brought in for the quasi-invasion). With the recruitment event off the board, Black Tusk was set back considerably.\n\n=== Coney Island ===\nLater on, The Division found out that the missing Russian virologist [[Vitaly Tchernenko]] was being held captive by Black Tusk on [[Coney Island]] after they made a deal with rogue agent [[Aaron Keener]]. The Division quickly moved in to liberate Tchernenko fighting their way through the [[Coney Island Ballpark]], eventually liberating the virologist and eliminating B.T.S.U. operative [[Elijah Sumner]]. Only to be suprised by a sudden attack on Coney Island by the [[Cleaners]], orchestrated by [[Vivian Conley]] and Keener. BTSU Commander [[Dolores Jones]] figured Keener is still inside the park and ordered her men to find and kill Keener. This leads Division agents to use this information to try and capture him before he gets away and fighting their way through the abandoned [[Coney Island Amusement Park]], killing both Black Tusk and Cleaners in the process. However, the Cleaners blew up the rollercoaster, killing most of the remaining Black Tusk in the process and cornering in Jones and what is left of her forces. Division agents then finished off what is left of the Black Tusk and neutralize Jones. While Keener managed to escape, this was a major blow to the Black Tusk branch in [[New York City|New York]].\n\n=== Warlords of New York ===\nThe faction, however, gained surprising allies from New York during the [[Warlords of New York]] campaign, recruiting the remnants of [[Last Man Battalion|LMB]] into their force. With their new troops, the Black Tusk has mostly regained their attack power. Their new troops introduced new archetypes into Black Tusk. The ex-LMB Rushers and ex-LMB Supports.\n\nPrior to Warlords of New York, [[Faye Lau]] made contact with [[Bardon Schaeffer]] regarding the exchange of a fellow rogue agent [[Alicia Coswald]]. She willingly let Black Tusk have her in exchange for information about their own supply routes in New York City.\n\nLater on, The Division made their move on [[Liberty Island]] to eliminate [[Aaron Keener]]. Black Tusk made every effort to stop the agents from eliminating Keener as they had their own agenda against the rogue agent. Despite their efforts in stopping the boat the agents took in and deploying the [[DDP-52 Razorback|Razorback]] on the island, they failed. They suffered a major setback when Keener hacked their  [[XB-31 \"Marauder\"|Marauder Quadcopter]] and a number of Warhounds and were forced to retreat.\n\nIntercepted through Keener's watch after his death, Schaeffer was conversing with Faye Lau (who was acting \"rogue\") regarding the activation of the [[Rogue Network]]. While Bardon was concerned over the number of rogue agents scattered throughout the country, Faye reassured him that it will bring The Division to its knees and they will be able to end them once and for all. \n\n=== Manhunt ===\nFew days after the Warlords of New York, several squads of Black Tusk soldiers came into [[Jason \"Titan\" Barnes|Titan]]. They joined up with him for a bit before being killed by Division agents, along with Titan himself. In addition, Schaeffer tried to recruit [[Carter \"Hornet\" Leroux]] into the fold but got rebuked by the Rogue Agent, informing Schaeffer that he (Hornet) made himself clear that \"Keener lives on in more ways than he could think of,\" making it clear that Hornet's only boss is Keener, and no one else.\n\n=== Concealed Agenda ===\nNot long after Hornet's Cell was elimiated, Bardon decided to lead a manhunt cell and send his lieutenants to recruit [[Hyenas]], [[Outcasts]], [[True Sons]], and [[Rikers]] to wreck havoc on The Division. [[Marley \"Shade\" Yarrow|Shade]] ha recruited Rikers to cause havoc while she recruited more rogue agents for Black Tusk. [[Sueko \"Wraith\" Tanagi|Wraith]] recruited Hyenas to wreck havoc while other Black Tusk troops tried to recruit more rogue agents.\n\nEventually, after The Division took out Schaeffer's rogue agents, they tracked him down to the [[Coney Island Amusement Park]] and troed to apprehend him before he moves. The Amusement Park iwas full of [[Rikers]] which seemed to be looting the place. There was also a [[Deceit|Hunter]] on site which the agents assumed was there to eliminate Schaeffer. Fighting through the park, the Hunter seemed to be toying with the agents until Schaeffer told the Hunter to \"stop playing games, finish it\". After the agents neutralized the Hunter, Schaeffer was heard talking to [[Natalya Sokolova]] telling her the Hunter is dead. She responded with \"that it's now up to him and his elite BTSU. operatives\". In the end the agents eliminated Schaeffer's operatives and critically wound him, leaving him in a coma. Schaeffer was apprehended and sent to the White House for medical care.\n\n=== End of Watch ===\nA short time after Schaeffer was apprehended, The Division got word of the ex-Division commander [[Faye Lau]] had assembled a group of rogue agents: [[Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas]], [[Felix \"Kestrel\" Sokolov]], [[Dustin \"Magnus\" Xavier]] and [[Alicia \"Circe\" Coswald]] for a secret mission.\n\nAfter The Division eliminated the rogue agents, they tracked Lau down to Camp White Oak where she had set up a meeting with [[President Ellis]]. The agents moved in to apprehend Ellis and take down Lau. After Division agents eliminated Ellis' bodyguards, they found out that Faye had assassinated the President and was trying to frame it on The Division. The agents moved in to neutralize Lau while a chopper was on it's way to extract her. The agents found Lau and took out the chopper, forcing her to engage the agents in combat. After a harsh fight, the agents eliminated Lau. \n\n=== Hidden Alliance ===\nNot long after Faye's death, The Division discovered that she was working as a double agent and left some recordings between her and Schaeffer, revealing that Lau was trying to help the Division and that Schaeffer has defected. She also left recordings between Natalya Sokolova and [[Calvin McManus]], which the Hunter was sent to keep an eye on Schaeffer and his rogue agent retinue, and kill the rogue agents under his command if they pose a problem. At the same time The Division found out that the Black Tusk has been working with the [[True Sons]]. This alliance however quickly faded after the death of rogue agent [[Linette \"Dusk\" Edwards|Dusk]]. \n\nIn an attempt to take down [[Captain Lewis]], The Division went to [[Jefferson Trade Center]], from which the True Sons captain had sent a distress call after encountering heavy Black Tusk resistance. The agents then teamed up with Lewis to take out the Black Tusk and take back the Trade Center. While encountering heavy Black Tusk resistance themselves, the agents kept encountering [[Brian Johnson|\"the recruiter\"]]. A Hunter was there to evaluate BTSU. operative [[Jack Bonney]] and see if he is a good fit for the Hunters. After being ambushed, Captain Lewis called in a [[DC-62]] airstrike in an attempt to stop Bonney from escaping. The agents then engaged Bonney, who had his own air support in the form of a [[XB-31 \"Marauder\"|marauder quadcopter]]. Nonetheless, he falls prey to the agents. But before they left, they retrieved his SHD Watch which has the status \"classified\". This left the agents with more questions than answers.\n\n=== Price of Power ===\nShortly after the events that took place at Jefferson Trade Center, General Anderson realized his True Sons don't have enough supplies and manpower to sustain a long-term conflict against The Division or the B.T.S.U., so he contacted Sokolova once again to rebuild their former alliance, with Natalya sending an advance team comprised of [[Mathias \"Trig\" Schneider]], [[Shawn \"Micro\" Clarke]], [[Sandra \"Chirpy\" Patterson]] and [[Mitchell \"Lucky\" Woods]] to aid the True Sons General in his operation. Captain Lewis didn't want anything to do with this alliance, so he asked the Division for help while he focused on recruiting any True Sons who were willing to defect. \n\nAfter all four of his Black Tusk lieutenants were taken down, Anderson prepared for his meeting with Natalya at the Pentco Fairview Power Plant, where he had also imprisoned the rogue Captain, and had the defected True Sons executed, for the most part. Eventually, Division agents would arrive on-site to rescue Lewis and attempt to kill Anderson. Anderson was escorted to the docks by his bodyguard [[Hank \"Bough\" Bibichev]], where he boarded a Black Tusk hovercraft and escaped the agents, who were successful in rescuing his former subordinate and taking out [[Nico \"Brain\" McPherson]]. The agents ran out of time, then made the call to extract rather than pursue Anderson. While waiting for their extraction, the agents were defending their position, fighting off Black Tusk and True Sons led by Bibichev, who was also killed by the agents. While the agents flew away, a fleet of Black Tusk hovercrafts was seen leaving the power plant. Aboard one of these are Anderson and Natalya conversing about what's next while Anderson told Natalya that his True Sons are at her disposal. \n\n=== Reign of Fire ===\nAfter the events at the [[Pentco Fairview Power Plant (Manhunt: General Anderson)|Pentco Fairview Power Plant]], the Black Tusk and True Sons have successfully re-built their alliance and working together to destroy the Division once and for all. \"Stovepipe\" and his team were tasked with gathering intel on the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]] to try and find out [[Bardon Schaeffer]]'s status after his capture, while [[Natalya Sokolova|Sokolova]] herself had her own plans and motives in mind. \n\nAfter eliminating [[Charles \"Chunks\" Crawford]], [[Lieutenant Bantam|Lieutenant Martin Bantam]], [[Mort \"Cursed\" Kellogg]], and [[Beatrice \"Auntie\" Kaplan]], the Division discovered [[Zachary \"Stovepipe\" Beattie|Stovepipe's]] location on Coney Island, as well as Sokolova's plan to use dirty bombs to carpet bomb [[Lower Manhattan]]. After hearing a decrypted conversation between \"Stovepipe\" and Sokolova herself over her secrecy and how done he was with her lies, agents were sent to [[Coney Island Ballpark (Manhunt: Stovepipe)|Coney Island Ballpark]] to find \"Stoveipipe and try to capture him before he could decimate New York. \n\nUpon arrival, agents made their way to Stovepipe's location near the mortar launchers left behind from the last Black Tusk [[Coney Island Ballpark|mission on Coney Island]], they soon discovered that Sokolova had killed \"Stovepipe\" for his disloyalty well before they arrived, and were ambushed by a plethora of Black Tusk UAVs, Minitanks, Warhounds, and even 2 [[XB-31 \"Marauder\"|XB-31 \"Marauder\" Quadcopters]]. As the agents fought their way to the extraction point, they were met with a final challenge: Sparkle, a prototype Flamethrower Warhound.\n\nThe agents fought against [[Sparkle]] who despite having support from other lesser Warhounds and UAVs, was destroyed. As agents signaled [[Torres]] to extract them, [[Candice Wallace|\"Wally\"]], who had been acting as mission control, revealed that \"Stovepipe\", the dirty bombs, and the ambush were a diversion: Sokolova sent the Black Tusk to breach the [[White House (Zone)|White House]] and eliminate a comatose [[Bardon Schaeffer]]. Despite the countermeasure they deployed, the Division managed to [[Take Back the White House|push them back from the White House]], although the base of operations suffered damage. Additionally they managed to capture the perfusion bioreactor in addition to kidnapping [[Vitaly Tchernenko]] and [[Harlan Lloyd]].  \n\nAnd to add further insult, they also kidnapped several key civilians from the Castle Settlement which includes: [[Mari Singh]], [[Eva Garcia]], [[Lauren Fong]], [[Mitchell Billings]], [[Cindy McAllister]], [[Mel Arnold]], [[Jack Arnold]], and [[Vikram Malik]]. \n\n=== Broken Wings/Puppeteers ===\nRealizing that a strong force wasn't enough and in order to present themselves as legitimate, Sokolova had the Black Tusk treat the kidnapped civilians humanely and arrange them work based on their skills and background. But it was only a matter of time till the Division recovered and rescued the first group civillians from their captivity. And despite best efforts from high-ranking Black Tusk officers, agents also rescued [[Mari Singh]] who was held in [[Manning National Zoo (Save: Mari Singh)|Manning National Zoo.]] While Mari, [[Manny Ortega|Manny]], and [[Candice Wallace|Wally]] discussed their next steps, a Black Tusk drone intercepted them in the [[Castle Settlement]], with the drone operator confirming to Sokolova that the asset in place and awaits her orders.\n\nAs Division agents rescued more civilians from Black Tusk with <nowiki>''help''</nowiki> from Agent [[Brian Johnson]], they also deployed to [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: The Recruiter)|Camp White Oak]] to rescue [[Birdie Malik|Birdie]] while also bringing the [[Mobile SHD Server]] to Johnson's custody. However, a layer of deceit would uncover as it turned out Johnson is the Recruiter for the [[Hunters|Hunter Program]] and was attempting to put an end to the Division once and for all by escaping Camp White Oak with the mobile server. Thanks to Birdie's help, however, Black Tusk didn't succeed and the Recruiter was off the board. Nonetheless, with the revelation that Hunters are embedded in the Division and whether [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]] could be trusted, [[Natalya Sokolova|Sokolova]] used the opportunity to spread her [[Propaganda Broadcast|propaganda]] through broadcasts so she could sway civilians to her cause and side with Black Tusk.\n\n=== Vanguard ===\nWhile Division agents followed [[Vanguard|Agent Kelso's trail]] in New York, Black Tusk sent some squads to intercept Kelso as well. This trail would turn into a full-blown fight when Kelso's location got pinged on the [[Stranded Tanker (Manhunt: Alani Kelso)|Stranded Tanker.]] Black Tusk forces alongside the [[True Sons]] were sent there to find and capture [[Alani Kelso|\"Cassandra\"]] under direct orders from Natalya Sokolova. However, they found themselves against the Division who went there to find the missing agent. Despite a number of high-ranking officers, a Marauder quadcopter, and a [[Hunter (Freedom Mask)|Hunter]] who were there to stop them, they were defeated, leaving Sokolova frustrated. \n\n=== First Rogue ===\nWhile the agents were focused on completing the third trial Leto as part of [[First Rogue|Aaron Keener's tests]], they intercepted comms between Manny Ortega and Mari Singh. One comm in particular revealed that Black Tusk's communications has been going dark ever since Birdie breached their security back in [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: The Recruiter)|Camp White Oak]]. Furthermore, [[DIAMOND]], the AI system that acts as the backbone for Black Tusk's forces was mentioned as the motive for Faye Lau's part in infiltrating the organization as she hoped to find the AI and neutralize it, effectively crippling Black Tusk's technological advantage \n\nWhen SHD agents focused on completing the Nyx trial, Black Tusk was part of the final objective as a squad to be eliminated. Additionally, they intercepted comms between Keener and Manny, allowing them to locate the rogue agent in Federal Emergency Bunker. In a race against time, agents fought through Black Tusk personnel while making their way through the traps. Eventually, they met with Keener and were confronted by [[Chimera]], an experimental Warhound using mixed abilities from previous Warhounds chassis (Marksman, Minigun, Grenadier), immunity shield, and can heal itself when sustaining critical damage.  \n\nWith Keener's help, Chimera was put down for good by the agents, denying Black Tusk their victory. When Keener was put in incarceration in the White House, he shared information to Manny about the Cabal; a shadow organization of powerful people, in which Natalya Sokolova is a member. \n\n=== Shades of Red ===\nWhile Black Tusk's troops weren't confronted directly [[Shades of Red|during the Division's trail to find]] [[Theo Parnell|Theo Parnell,]] they were involved in the Hyenas attack on [[Space Administration HQ: Theo Parnell|Space Adminstration HQ]] as it turned out the organization decided to recommit on supplying the faction in their war against the Division. A BTSU Operative, [[Marty \"Sparrow\" Kincaid]], supervised the attack where he promised a Hyena member, [[Bichon]], a seat on the rebuilt [[Hyena Council|Council]] if he and the Hyenas captured Theo Parnell. However, SHD agents managed to recover and extract Parnell before the Hyenas got him. To slow Black Tusk's advance in fully rebuilding the Hyena Council, the agents intercepted and eliminated Bichon despite his tough armor and backpack. \n\nThe fact that Black Tusk willingly recommitted to suppling the Hyenas despite cutting off their ties with them during the events in ''[[Price of Power]]'' shows they're using whatever measures necessary to defeat the Division. \n\n=== Burden of Truth ===\nWhile the Black Tusk weren't encountered during the Division's incursion to Roosevelt Island to recover Faye Lau's Mobile SHD Server, Natalya Sokolova was heard on the radio as she was overseeing the True Sons' operation handled by General Peter Anderson there to recover the server. Despite the fight that True Sons gave, the Division triumphed and recovered the server, which led to Nat calling off the operation and expressing her disappointment to Anderson.\n\n=== Brooklyn ===\nAt some point, they established a foothold in Brooklyn. Black Tusk officer, [[Richard Danvers]], was put in charge of the operation, where he'd take over leadership of the Cleaners. Danvers also recruited SFX artist [[Matthew Grant]] to the group due to making a commercial for [[Natalya Sokolova]] around ten years ago and for his CGI expertise. Additionally, Danvers was involved in manufacturing manufactured a new and powerful accelerant for the Cleaners dubbed \"Purple Flame\".\n\nDanvers was ordered by Sokolova to lead an operation  alongside Cleaner Commander and [[Hunters|Hunter Program]] Agent [[Wright]] to recover [[Mackenzie Meret]] from her Estate, in which they would also take the opportunity to test-run their new weapon. Despite the failure of recovering Mack and losing both Wright and the Lovebirds, the test-run results for the purple flame was a success. And Danvers' Cleaners would begin mass-producing the weapon in H5 Refinery in Brooklyn\n\nBecause of Grant's past as an SFX artist, he was ordered to create deepfake videos of Keener using tech from the Descent simulation program, to create propaganda against Keener and the Bridge settlement. \n\nAfter Sarah Moretti took leadership of the Rikers, Danvers recruited her, which she gladly accepted as she wanted revenge against the Bridge, even having her fake her death and using a voice modulator to hide her identity. With resources from Black Tusk, the Rikers established a supply depot in a subway underneath Clarke Street Hotel as well as as setting up a SAM Site in Bridge Park Pier, thus becoming stronger than ever.\n\nBlack Tusk's real goal, however, was Gordon Amherst's printer that Keener used to create Eclipse Virus. Thanks to intel from the \"Rat Queen\", theu're aware the printer was held in a vault within The Bridge's basement. Thus their mission is two-fold: Having the Rikers launch massive attack on the settlement to take the printer, and capture Dr. Jessica Kandel to force her into using the printer for their own agenda.\n\nHowever, the arrival of D.C Division Agents to Brooklyn had caused a substantial setback for Black Tusk, as the agents had destroyed the refinery and captured the \"Rat Queen\", eventually leading them to Black Tusk's stronghold: Army Terminal.\n\nDuring the Division's assault, Black Tusk soldiers tried to stall the agents, but to no avail, even taking a small nuclear reactor from them. In a desperate attempt, Danvers and his crew boarded a massive armored Zeppelin equipped with Purple Flame bombs, and lifted off with a course set for The Bridge, which they planned to destroy. \n\nHowever, the agents were taking over the SAM launchers, so Black Tusk sent an LM-21 \"Marauder\" to take them down in addition to several Black Tusk soldiers as reinforcements. Yet, even that didn't stop the agents as they managed to take over the SAMs, and launched missiles at the Zeppelin, damaging it enough to crash into the sea, killing Richard Danvers and stopping Black Tusk from destroying The Bridge.\n\nWith the past and current events in mind, Black Tusk's intentions with Amherst's printer had become more clear. The printer itself was used to create the Green Poison. And since Black Tusk has the Perfusion Bioreactor they took from the Division during their assault on the White House, the PMC was more than likely intending to use the printer create a bioweapon and have a monopoly on creating vaccines, to force the still-rebuilding settlements across America to bend the knee.\n\nAlthough they didn't succeed in obtaining the printer, it does paint a target on the Division's back. Moreover, Black Tusk had shipped off the Purple Flame accelerant to other parts of the country, which they could use to supply hostile factions to attack civilian settlements, likely to force them to submit their allegiance to the PMC.\n\n== Branches ==\nMuch like the Last Man Battalion from ''Tom Clancy's The Division, ''the Black Tusk is the only faction in ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ''that has multiple branches in its ranks.\n\n=== Black Tusk ===\nThe main entity out of the three branches, but the only time they are encountered is the invaded stronghold of Manning National Zoo during a recruiting event. They share the same uniform as their B.T.S.U. counterparts. According to [[Alani Kelso|Agent Kelso]] in an audio file, Black Tusk specializes in low spec ops: get in, do the job, and get out.\n\n\n=== B.T.S.U. (Black Tusk Special Unit) ===\nThe Black Tusk Special Unit (B.T.S.U) is the most common enemy encountered in the streets and in the invaded missions. They share the same uniform as their regular Black Tusk counterparts; however, they have access to more powerful and technologically advanced equipment, giving them the edge they need to specifically target Division agents.\n\n\n=== White Tusk ===\nThe [[White Tusk]] is the strongest branch out of the three and only seen on Legendary strongholds. White Tusk is controlled by the Black Tusk directly, rather than the B.T.S.U. They are the opposite of their Black Tusk and B.T.S.U. counterparts: on top of their uniforms being pure white, their job is to hold a high-value position with heavy firepower. They are composed predominantly of former [[Last Man Battalion|LMB]] and other Black Tusk units. They were also featured in the third novel of [[Operation Crossroads|Operation Crossroads trilogy;]] [[Tom Clancy's The Division: Hunted|Hunted]]\n==Quotes==\n* ''Drones in the air! - ''Warning other fellow Black Tusk members of such UAV usage\n* Shoot 'em, dammit! - a male Black Tusk member getting frustrated that other Black Tusk soldiers are not pouring it on the Division agent\n* ''Pour it on!''\n* ''Agent's back on their feet! - A ''male Black Tusk member catching a Division agent red-handed using an armor kit or healing skill\n* ''You'll pay for killing one of ours!

(which led to the Black Tusk taking over Manning National Zoo for a recruiting program); meanwhile the autonomy a Division agent has given them the freedom to [[Rogue Status|go rogue]], but it means that killing off specific field agents won't be detrimental to their overall focus.\n* Throughout the events of ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2, ''it is shown that while the Black Tusk field commanders are strategically smart, they often butt-heads and compete with each other. This has been an Achilles' heel for them in some of their more high-value operations.\n* Some civilians know of the Black Tusk's existence with one even saying \"Black Tusk are paranoid.

He was the Prime Target of [[Puppeteers (Year 5 Season 2)|Puppeteers]]. \n\nAfter the events at [[Coney Island Amusement Park (Manhunt: Schaeffer)|Coney Island Amusement Park]] and [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: Faye Lau)|Camp White Oak]], which resulted in the death of a [[\"Deceit\"|fellow Hunter]] and [[Faye Lau]], The Recruiter was tasked by McManus to observe and train [[Black Tusk|B.T.S.U.]] Operative [[Jack Bonney]] as a potential candidate for the program.\n\n==History ==\nLike many kids growing up in Santa Cruz, Brian Johnson too up surfing at an early age, and he was set on becoming a professional. But a bad breakup had him rashly enlisting in the navy and later joining the [[Wikipedia:Baltimore_Police_Department|Police Department]] in Baltimore, where he became a sniper with their quick response team.\n\nHe was recruited by the [[Strategic Homeland Division]] along the way, where he participated in early demonstrations of the [[Descent|Descent combat simulation]] alongside [[Vivian Conley]]. One demonstration had him being tested with a .50 cal round in the simulation to assess the simulated pain a field operative can feel while wearing the telemetric suits. He felt the pain, which pleased both [[Claire Ortiz]] and [[Calvin McManus]].\n\nOnce the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] was unleashed, he spent his time in the early days trying to combat the growing chaos while watching his friends succumb to the disease. In that time, Brian saw things that emotionally scarred him deeply, and he was still processing that trauma.\n\nThe early days of the outbreak were hard days for Brian. All his friends in Baltimore, especially at the BPD died and he stayed at Fort Meade, trying to forget those terrible things. Some day, two Division agents arrived at the Fort. They introduced them as [[Caleb Dunne]] and [[Heather Ward]]. They need help to decrypt a device which should hold information on [[Mantis]]. Meeting Ward and Dunne was a good thing for Brian, seeing their clear sense of mission was a huge motivation for him. He realized that there was no more time to hide and think about the bad days of the early outbreak and all the sad happenings during this time. He got back his self-confidence and his strength.\n\nHe pushed aside the bad memories and after a few days with Dunne and Ward he was fully briefed on Mantis and so he decided to join them on their mission.\n\nNot long after his arrival in [[Washington, D.C.]], Agent Johnson mysteriously disappeared, leading his fellow agents Heather Ward and Caleb Dunne to believe he either went [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue]] or was killed. It was neither, Johnson, being loyal to [[Calvin McManus]]'s ideals, ended up joining the [[Hunters|Hunter Program]] through unknown means and becoming one of their highest ranking officers. At some point, he contacted [[Task Force Proteus|JTF Squad Proteus]] to bring a [[Mobile SHD Server]] to [[Kenly College]] in the outskirts of D.C., though he didn't arrive to the location. Why Johnson wasn't there is not known, but it could be deduced that he waited for the [[Outcasts]] to kill off the squad and pry the server from their hands, though that didn't happen as the Outcasts in Kenly College got ambitious and used the server and the supplies from Proteus to plan a devastating attack towards D.C. \n\nAfter the events of ''[[Warlords of New York]]'', he was directly tasked by Calvin McManus to train and observe [[Jack Bonney]] as potential recruit for the program, giving him access to an [[Smart Watch|SHD Smart Watch]] with Classified Status, as well as access to the Hunters' Unidentified network. During a mission to [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center]], The Recruiter, accompanied by Bonney's [[Black Tusk|B.T.S.U.]], would slaughter most of Captain [[Captain Lewis|Frederick Lewis]]'s [[True Sons]], leaving him as the sole survivor, who would later team up with The Division.\n\nAs Division agents stormed the facility and slowly took down the B.T.S.U. operatives, he would often make himself known, appearing from time to time only to taunt the agents, disappearing in a cloud of blue smoke whenever the agents got too close.\n\nDespite Bonney's confidence and efforts to impress his superior, he was eventually killed in action by the agents, even with the help of the Recruiter's [[SHD Tech]], leaving the Hunter to disappear once more in his cloud of blue colored smoke.\n\nThe Recruiter is mentioned once again when he escorted the hostage [[John Yazzie]] and gave him to [[Gabriel \"Dynamite\" Gonzalez]]. Later, when the agents are rescuing [[Mari Singh]] at the [[Manning National Zoo]], The Recruiter can be seen in a blue smoke-screen on top of a balcony, simply watching as the agents extract the hostage after having killed B.T.S.U. operative [[Felicity \"Panther\" Lee]].\n\nAfter the successful rescue of Mari Singh, he would take a more active role in dealing with the remaining hostages, as the Hunter would now be hunted down himself.\n\nThe following days after Mari's rescue, The Recruiter would be responsible for overseeing the escort of captured hostages [[Cindy McAllister]], [[Mel Arnold]], [[Jack Arnold]], [[Vikram Malik]] and his sister \"Birdie\". Simultaneously, Johnson would show up at the Castle Settlement and pretend to help to agents with each of the rescues, not showing his true intentions, which were to gain their trust in order to recover the mobile SHD server and bring it to [[Natalya Sokolova]].\n\nAfter the rescue of Vikram Malik, Johnson and the agents go to [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: The Recruiter)|Camp White Oak]] in order to rescue his sister, \"[[Birdie Malik|Birdie]]\", bringing the server with them. Amidst instabilities in the server and the agents assault on the Black Tusk and True Sons soldiers at the camp, Birdie reveals to the agents she was told by Sokolova that the Division and Black Tusk were now allies, and she was sent there alongside agent Johnson, who she reveals that Johnson was the traitor to the Division cause.\n\nJohnson, after realizing that his cover was blown due to Birdie's info, and in a desperate attempt to escape Camp White Oak with the stolen server, engages the agents in combat while waiting for the extraction helicopter sent by Natalya. During the fight, Johnson is mostly protected by his SHD Defender Drone, leading Birdie to use the Black Tusk's countermeasure to deactivate both his and the agents' SHD tech, leaving him temporarily vulnerable. After a tough battle, the Sheriff heads back into the lodge, leaving Johnson to be hit by a mortar strike sent by Birdie, collapsing on the floor and succumbing from his injuries.\n\nBefore his death, Johnson left behind a series of insurance comms in D.C., where it was discovered by Division agents. Those comms explain his disappearance, his discontent with Agent Kelso's methods, as well his motivations to join the Hunter program.\n\n=== Legacy ===\nBrian's death and his identity shook things for the Division and their allies in Washington, D.C. The agents were forced to face the harsh reality that Hunters are embedded among them, raising suspicion and doubt in the White House and Castle settlements, even questioning if Agent Alani Kelso can be trusted, given her former CIA background. While Kelso did go rogue, she is no Hunter, as she's allied herself with Aaron Keener and Theo Parnell to help in stopping the Black Tusk and the Hunters.\n\nDuring one of their incursions in the Descent simulation facility, Division agents intercept a comm of Keener and Bridgette Douglas where they discuss about recruiting Jack Arnold. Apparently, Jack was tricked by the Hunters to go to Kenly College where she and her squad were left to die. Therefore, it can be concluded that Brian deliberately sent Jack and her JTF squad Proteus to their deaths so he could pry the Mobile SHD Server from their custody.\n\nAdditionally, after Bardon Schaeffer was recovered from his coma and got to debrief with Manny Ortega, they had a conversation about Brian Johnson, where Manny admitted he let his guard down with Brian, which made the Agent able to manipulate him. Schaeffer, on the other hand, argued that Brian was an honest and trustworthy man who just wanted to do the right thing.\n\n== Personality ==\nBrian Johnson is haunted with emotional scars over the chaos of the [[Green Poison]] and the loss of his friends, leading him to be a recluse. His meeting and friendship he struck with [[Heather Ward]] and [[Caleb Dunne]] allowed him to regain his self-confidence and steel his resolve. However, by the time he became a [[Hunters|Hunter]], he cut contact with them, as he believed his work is more important. And due to personal history with [[Calvin McManus]], he's loyal to Cal's ideals for the United States.\n\nHe had personal resentment towards [[Alani Kelso]], as he felt her methods are reckless for a [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agent and believed that she'd go [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue]]. He was also manipulative as he used the Division and [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] during the events of ''[[Puppeteers (Year 5 Season 2)|Puppeteers]]'' to get access to the [[Mobile SHD Server]] and put an end to the conflict. A similar case happened with [[Task Force Proteus|JTF Squad Proteus]] when he ordered them to bring a Mobile SHD Server to [[Kenly College (Expedition)|Kenly College]].\n\nJohnson was known to be dogmatic in his belief, believing in the ideals that Calvin McManus has for the United States and that the Division should devote itself to thr mission of what it was supposed to be: Ensure continuity of government. During his confrontation with Division agents, Brian claimed that he and his fellow Hunters are the ones on mission and accused the agents of being off-mission and going rogue the moment they allied with [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]] regardless of what [[ISAC]] thinks.\n\n\n==Equipment==\n\n=== Promotional Material ===\n*In the promotional action figurine, Brian Johnson is armed with a [[TAC-50 C Rifle]], [[M9/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Beretta M9]], [[Vector/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Vector 45 ACP]], [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Flash Bangs]], and a Ka-Bar combat knife.\n*The promotional cinematic/live-action/gameplay trailers includes a [[Hive|Stinger Hive]], [[T821]], [[M4/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|M4 carbine]], [[Rhino/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Rhino Revolver]] and a [[AUG A3/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|AUG A3-CQC]].\n*Brian Johnson's backpack trophy is the 'Tommy the Teddy Bear'.\n\n=== In-game (as The Recruiter) ===\n*In-game, The Recruiter is a unique Hunter armed with a [[TAC-50 C Rifle]], [[POF P416/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Custom P416 G3]], [[Drone (Skill)|SHD Defender Drone]], [[Pulse/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Jammer Pulse]] and [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Airburst Incendiary Grenades]]. Like other Hunters, he could also hack the player's skills.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Brian Johnson's backpack trophy, 'Tommy the Teddy Bear', was an exclusive pre-order bonus for the PC version ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''; however, the code itself was compatible with the PC, PS4, or Xbox One versions of the game.\n*During his brief appearances in [[Hidden Alliance|Season 9]] and [[Broken Wings|Year 5 Season 1]], The Recruiter's re-used the Crimson Hunter's (nicknamed \"Jiang Ziya\") name, model, weapons and skills. Later, in Year 5 Season 2, his appearance was remodeled to have his own unique look (this included changing his in-game model in his previous appearances).\n**Prior to his design change in Y5S2, The Recruiter was depicted as a Hunter armed with a [[M60/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Black Market M60 E6]], [[UMP-45/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Tactical UMP-45]], [[Drone (Skill)|SHD Bombardier Drones]], [[Chem Launcher|SHD Riot Foam Chem-Launcher]], [[Pulse/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Jammer Pulse]] and [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Concussion Grenades]]. He also had a Striker Drone that hovers in place beside him, but neither him nor his drone engage the player directly.\n**Prior to the Y5S2.1 Update, The Recruiter could be seen (already in his new design) holding an [[M1A/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|M1A CQB]], this was swapped for a [[TAC-50 C Rifle]] to match with the season's launch trailer.\n* During his appearance in [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center Manhunt: Captain Lewis]], the Recruiter never engages the player directly, only sending modified EMP Drones to aid [[Jack Bonney]] and the [[Black Tusk]] during their fight against the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]].\n**However, it is possible to prompt him to attack the player on extremely rare instances.\n*Despite never being mentioned in the mission's dialogue, the Recruiter does appear at the very end of [[Manning National Zoo (Save: Mari Singh)|Manning National Zoo: Save Mari Singh]], right after the player shoots the flare to call Torres for extraction. He appears in a blue smoke screen on the window of the overlook where [[Felicity \"Panther\" Lee]] was previously at.\n*Brian Johnson had appeared commercially in Ubisoft's live action trailer of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hepJEdpkxLs&ab_channel=Ubisoft|OFFICIAL THE DIVISION 2 - DRAWING LIVE ACTION TRAILER]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRzfF6ZllzA&lc=&ab_channel=Ubisoft|OFFICIAL THE DIVISION 2 - GOOD GUY LIVE ACTION TRAILER]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs2aHgh7tS4&ab_channel=UbisoftNorthAmerica|Tom Clancy's The Division 2: Official Cinematic TV Spot | Ubisoft [NA]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ1hdbF2fZk&ab_channel=UbisoftNorthAmerica|Tom Clancy's The Division 2: E3 2019 Episode 3 Teaser Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]]\n**Since Episode 3 Teaser Trailer was the last appearance of Brian Johnson as a Division Agent, It is presumed that during his travel to New York with [[Caleb Dunne]] and [[Heather Ward]], Brian manage to somehow join the Hunters.\n*Brian Johnson was commercially featured as a statue figurine and as an action/articulated figurine.\n*It is still unknown why ISAC did not detect the Hunter network whenever Johnson showed up at the Castle Settlement prior to the reveal of his identity as The Recruiter. \n*Brian Johnson is the second Hunter in the franchise to have voice lines and also involved in a main story mission. \n*Unlike most of his fellow Hunters, The Recruiter doesn't have Smart Watches stitched to his uniform. \n*Brian Johnson's outfit from the ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'' E3 2018 trailer is available as a downloadable Outfit from [[Ubisoft Connect]] for 100 Units.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBrian Johnson.jpg|Johnson as a Division agent\nSzabat-marauderwoman-5.jpg|Johnson and his team\nBrian johnson extremis malis.png|Johnson, as he appears in ''Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis''\nFile:Recruiter Keyart (HQ).png|The Recruiter's keyart in Puppeteers\nFile:The Recruiter (trailer).png\nFile:The Recruiter (aiming).png\nFile:Recruiter Jefferson Trade Center.png|Recruiter in [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Missions==\n*[[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center Manhunt: Captain Lewis]]\n*[[Manning National Zoo (Save: Mari Singh)|Manning National Zoo: Save Mari Singh]]\n*[[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: The Recruiter)|Camp White Oak: The Recruiter]]\n\n\n==Other Media==\n===''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad''=== \n[[File:Brian Johnson 01.png|thumb|130px]]Brian Johnson was featured in ''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad'' as part of The Division faction.

He is featured in various promotional material for ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2]]'' and is a protagonist\u00a0 of ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis|Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division: Extremis Malis.]]''\n\nAfter his friend and fellow Division agent [[Mathias Kaminsky]] was killed by the Black Tusk operative [[Mantis]], Dunne left New York to pursue his partner\u2019s killer across the eastern United States. He eventually formed a cell alongside agents [[Heather Ward]] and [[Brian Johnson]].\n\n==Biography==\nCaleb Dunne served as a Combat Medic Specialist in the U.S. Army before becoming an emergency medical technician in New York City. His extraordinary combat record and solid reputation caught the attention of SHD recruiters, and he was recruited soon afterwards.\n\nDunne eventually formed a close bond with fellow agent Mathias Kaminsky. During the Green Poison pandemic in Manhattan, they were both activated as part of The Division\u2019s First Wave. One of their first missions together was locating [[Padilla]], a \"fixer\" loosely associated with the [[Last Man Battalion]]. The pair tracked him to Greenwich Village, where they coerced him to become a Division asset instead.\n\n\n===''Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division: Extremis Malis''===\nFollowing the death of [[Charles Bliss]], the remnants of the LMB were revitalized when they suddenly began receiving heavy weaponry from an unknown supplier. Based on information from Padilla, Acting Commander [[Faye Lau]] assigned Kaminsky and Dunne to raid a warehouse in Chinatown and apprehend the weapons supplier, with support from the JTF. The operation ended in tragedy when Kaminsky was killed by a female operative named Mantis, who sliced his throat and escaped. \n\nDunne eventually tracked Mantis to the North River Wastewater Plant, where he witnessed her talking with rogue agent [[Ike Ronson]]. He found Mantis\u2019s safehouse underground, which contained loose SHD [[Smart Watch|Smart Watches]] and a map detailing operations across the East Coast, including between New York City and Philadelphia. Mantis returned and, after a scuffle, activated the hideout\u2019s self-destruct explosives and fled. Dunne barely escaped, and was recovered by JTF personnel. After recovering, Dunne left New York City for Philadelphia, in pursuit of Mantis.\n\nIn New Jersey, Dunne encountered fellow SHD agent [[Heather Ward]], who invited him to the nearby [[Camden Settlement]]. They found the settlement under attack by [[The Founders]], a local insurrectionist faction, and fended them off together. With the help of a defector named [[Timmy]], the trio infiltrated the Founder's headquarters at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. They recovered a SATCOM transceiver, then destroyed the armory with explosive charges, although Timmy was shot and killed during their escape.\n\nIn hopes of decrypting the transceiver, Dunne and Ward traveled to Fort Meade and met another agent, [[Brian Johnson]], who joined their cell. The three agents bonded and recuperated for several weeks, until the NSA tracked Mantis' signal a farm outside Fredrick. The team killed Mantis's [[Black Tusk]] soldiers and destroyed Mantis' escape vehicle. Dunne overpowered Mantis and began choking her to death in a rage, only relenting at Ward's insistence. As they detained Mantis, the [[SHD Network]] went offline, and their watches displayed the coordinates \u201c''[[D.C. Base of Operations|38.8975, -77.0375]]''\u201d. The trio then escorted Mantis to the nearby Fort Detrick, only to find it destroyed. A Black Tusk sniper then shot Mantis through the head and departed.\n\nNo longer seeking revenge, Dunne and his cell subsequently followed their watch coordinates to [[Washington, D.C.]], where they arrived two weeks later.\n\n\n===''Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2''===\nIn Washington D.C.\u2019s [[West End]], Dunne and his fellow Division agent [[Melisa Corluka]] were interviewed by journalist Alex Takahashi regarding their experiences during the initial outbreak. Their conversation was preserved via [[ECHO]].\n\nWhen [[Aaron Keener]] and the [[Cleaners]] resurfaced at [[Coney Island]], Dunne left Washington, D.C. and returned to New York alongside Ward and Johnson. His fate thereafter is unknown. \n\n\n==Personality==\nAlthough Dunne is known for his tenacity and drive, he never quite reconciled being both a warrior and a healer. He was initially jovial and light-hearted when operating alongside [[Mathias Kaminsky|Matthias Kaminsky]]; after his friend's death, his gave himself over fully to his warrior side, becoming singularly obsessed with hunting down [[Mantis]] and exacting revenge. \n\nUnlike his teammate [[Heather Ward]], Dunne showed no remorse in taking lives or endangering bystanders like [[Timmy]] for his own ends, and although he felt some measure of guilt over Timmy's death, he continued to mask his personal vendetta as a mission on behalf of [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]]. While Ward and [[Brian Johnson|Johnson]] relaxed and enjoyed hobbies like art and sports during their stay at Fort Meade, Dunne merely grew restless at the lull in action and eager to continue pursuing Mantis, fearing she may have already changed her ''modus operandi''. \n\nIt was only as Dunne was choking Mantis to death that he ultimately chose to stay true to The Division and his humanity, sparing her life and letting go of his hatred, which he realized brought him only emptiness. Shortly afterwards, Mantis' assassination, the destruction of Fort Detrick, and the loss of the [[SHD Network]] frightened Dunne, who could not imagine what group could have carried out a plan on such a scale. \n\n\n==Equipment==\n*In promotional trailers for ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'', Dunne carries a [[M249 B/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Military MK46]] with an attached [[Optic|552 Holo Sight]], a [[Super 90/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Marine Super 90]] with an attached [[Underbarrel|Handstop]], an [[M1911/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|M1911]], and a [[Crossbow]], which can fire either conventional and explosive bolts. \n*In ''Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division: Extremis Malis'', Dunne carries a [[Px4 Storm/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Px4 Storm Type T]] as his sidearm.\n*In the promotional action figurine, Caleb Dunne is armed with a [[M1911]], [[Super 90/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Marine Super 90]], [[Crossbow]], Explosive [[Seeker Mine]], [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Flash Bangs]], and a Gerber StrongArm Tactical Knife.\n*Caleb Dunne's backpack trophy is the 'Baseball Ball'.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Caleb Dunne's outfit from the ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'' E3 2018 trailer is available as a downloadable Outfit from [[Ubisoft Connect]] for 100 Units.\n==Other Media==\n===''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad''===\n[[File:Caleb Dunne 01.png|thumb|130px]]Caleb Dunne was featured in ''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad'' as part of The Division faction.

You have the ability to heal your friends very fast, or even yourself over time.\n**The Reinforcer can even be used by the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Agent]] similarly as the [[First Aid]], by dropping the Reinforcer in their vicinity to heal themselves and regenerate their armor. The Reinforcer variant uses green-colored canisters.\n*The Firestarter canister sends out flammable, near-invisible gas. These gas clouds can be ignited with any spark\u2014bullet impacts, enemies firing their weapons inside the cloud, explosions or even enemies running into them while on fire. If you combine multiple clouds over a large area, you can create devastating chain reactions.\n**The Firestarter variant uses red-colored canisters (though the gas cloud is clear when launched).\n*The Riot Foam fires a canister with riot control foam that disperses on impact. The foam is sticky, heavy, and it expands rapidly. Anyone affected by the foam is stuck in place for a period of time, but the hardened foam can be destroyed to break them free.\n**The Riot Foam variant uses dark beige-colored canisters.\n*The Oxidizer fires a canister that emits a cloud of corrosive chemicals. The chemical cloud lingers for a long time and efficiently eats away at the armor and health of enemies caught within its radius, as well as damage devices such as health stations, turrets, and drones.\n**The Oxidizer can be used to reliably damage enemies that are behind cover, as well as push them out of it, and can be devastating when fired at enemy spawn points. It can also be used to great effect against Rusher and Tank archetypes, due to the predictability of the former's movements and the slow and sluggishness of the latter's. The Oxidizer variant uses purple-colored canisters.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nChem 1.png|Reinforcer Chem Launcher\nChem 2.png|Firestarter Chem Launcher\nChem 3.png|Riot Foam Chem Launcher\nChem 4.png|Oxidizer Chem Launcher\n181106 hunter gif chem 01 660x371 h264 v3 gif 341117.gif|An agent using the Chem Launcher on True Sons enemies\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n{{Weapon SHD Tech 2}}\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Skills]]\n[[Category:Abilities]]\n[[Category:SHD Tech]]",

Joint Task Force.  A militia formed in the wake of the collapse of the Washington, D.C. JTF and the rise of the True Sons, Hyenas, and Outcasts, this militia seeks to maintain their settlements' independence and promote non-violent survival.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIf the player decides to help the militia with various tasks like gathering food and supplies, the militia can be called in a battle to assist the player in capturing control points around the city.\n\nAfter a battle, militia officers might ask the player for some medications, food, water, and components. The Civilian Militia also guard the exterior of the White House with the help of [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] operatives. Civilian Militia members are also seen at different parts of the city patrolling and scavenging for items they want to bring back to their settlement. They are however not a united faction, being dispersed into many groups in various locations.\n\n== Equipment ==\nThe civilian militia have access to a vast array of scavenged weapons, but little equipment.\n\n* Their weapons vary widely, ranging from older shotguns and revolvers favored by Outcasts, to SMGs and pistols favored by the Hyenas, to high quality assault rifles and LMGs favored by the True Sons.\n* They have a limited access to secondary equipment, as most seem to favor WW2 era sling rigs, as well as hand torches and limited access to police equipment.\n* Most have limited combat training, as they display better tactics and equipment than the Outcasts or Underground, but are outmatched by better equipped enemies such as the Hyenas, or better trained opponents such as the True Sons.\n\n== Militia Types ==\n* Militia Soldiers - Militia soldiers make up the bulk of the Militia force. Armed with various weaponry (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns) they are most commonly seen capturing control points, patrolling areas, scavenging for supplies, and delivering supplies to control points and their respected settlement.\n* Militia Officers - Officers usually lead their squad into battle when taking over a control point and are seen training new recruits in target practice. Armed with only a pistol, they are the only member of the Militia that can revive agents if they are downed. They are usually indicated by a green star marker.\n* Settlement Guards - Sentry Guards are usually stationed at the entrances at their respected Settlements, protecting the entrances from hostiles, and are usually the ones to open up the entrance when they see a Division agent approaching.\n* Control Point Guards - Guards armed with various assault rifles. They are stationed around the perimeter around their control point, engaging in hostiles that are patrolling through and defending their control points from hostiles that want to capture it. If the control point has a mounted weapon, CP Guards will be the first to man it.\n* Scouts - Militia members armed with various marksman rifles and high-range binoculars. They are seen on platforms that have high altitude, recon the area for special nodes that have much needed supplies and check the streets for hostile patrols. Usually they are alone, but sometimes have another member on the ground for backup.\n*Rushers - Militia members armed with an ax or a baseball bat, they are only seen rescuing hostages and/or taking over control points. They are rare to spawn.\n\n== Quotes ==\n{{Quote|Here!  Take some of this shit!|A female Civilian Militia agent in a random attack quote against hostiles.}}\n{{Quote|Come on, people!

Many commuted to work from outside the city but got trapped in the urban quarantine zones during the early days of the [[Green Poison|plague]]. Others were inner-city dwellers who lost loved ones during the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]]. \n\nThey are one of the major [[Factions|enemy factions]] in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]'' and an enemy faction in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]].''\n\nResponding to what they perceived as the shameful failure of local and [[CERA|federal authorities]] to protect their health and families, a number of these blue-collar city workers banded together to take matters into their own hands, organized and armed by [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]]'s sanitation supervisor, [[Joe Ferro]]. The Cleaners aimed to eradicate the mutant smallpox [[Green Poison|virus]]. Their chosen method of killing is donning flamethrowers fueled by napalm. The Cleaners incinerated anything and anyone suspected of carrying the disease. This often included perfectly healthy survivors exposed to the virus.\n\nThe fanatical faction was initially hindered by [[CERA]]'s quarantine lines and checkpoints. But nobody knew the bowels of the [[Underground|burrow]] - the sewers, drainage tunnels, and subway lines - like Joe Ferro and his followers. Armed with flamethrowers, fire axes, firebombs, and firearms, they traversed the city's underground passages, bypassing roadblocks and perimeter barricades with ease. Their philosophy was to burn everything that had contact with the virus.\n\nTheir faction spread quickly, driven by Ferro's belief that \"the sick are already dead\". One file recovered from the Cleaners' headquarters site revealed phone-video footage of a civilian captured and burnt alive by a Cleaner. All [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents learned to proceed with extra caution in Cleaner-occupied territories, often identified by the presence of the faction's distinctive yellow garbage trucks, burning piles of corpses, and charred streets.\n\nEventually, after The Division's decimation of their ranks (including [[Joe Ferro]]) and the destruction of their [[Napalm Production Site|napalm facility]], the Cleaners no longer posed a major threat to the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] and citizenry of New York. Still, remnants of the Cleaners patrol the streets. \n\nHowever, the Cleaners recovered with the help of [[Vivian \"Uranus\" Conley|Vivian Conley]], one of [[Aaron Keener]]'s lieutenants. They launched an attack on [[Coney Island]] while [[Black Tusk]] was distracted by the attack of [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]]. They ruled over lower [[Lower Manhattan|Manhattan]], along with the [[Rikers]], but thanks to The Divison, the Cleaners fell apart once again after the death of Conley, the loss of all bases, strongholds, napalm and oil production.\n\n== Intelligence Brief ==\n{{Quote|Our work in New York was just the beginning. We will rid America of this contamination. By fire we will cleanse this place. By fire, our enemies will die. A new America will arise, free from disease!|Cleaner Leader 'McKinney', on the Cleaners' objectives for America}}\n[[File:Blue Collar.jpg|thumb|right|378x378px]]A roaming faction, the Cleaners can appear in many districts; all agents should proceed with extra caution, especially in Cleaner-occupied territories. The Cleaners consists of construction and sanitation workers that felt abandoned when the government and [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] pulled out and left them to defend themselves and die. Trapped in the quarantine zones, they decided to take matters into their own misguided hands. Armed with flamethrowers, fire axes, and firebombs, they travel from one area to another hoping to cleanse the city of the [[Green Poison|virus]]. A video recovered from the [[Napalm Production Site]] shows footage of a civilian's phone which shows that she is burnt alive by a Cleaner when she was caught at the site. To identify their territories, agents are advised to keep a lookout for yellow-colored garbage trucks.\n\nTheir weaponry is more advanced than the [[Rioters]], consisting of assault rifles, SMGs, Snipers, Shotguns and pistols, however also sporting homemade munitions and weapons, such as flamethrowers and incendiary grenades. They use more homemade weaponry than any other factions but the [[Outcasts]].\n\nEight months after the outbreak, the remaining Cleaners allied themselves with two [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Division]] agents, [[Vivian Conley]] and [[Javier Kajika]]. Conley helped the Cleaners upgrade their utilities and weapons, and now they are deadlier than ever. They have new gear, a base of operations, and even working vehicles and fuel production, as they can be seen all over [[Lower Manhattan]].\n\nAt the start of the manhunt, Vivian Conley was the leader of the Cleaners. Unknown to the Cleaners, she also does dealing with fellow Rogue Division Agents, [[Aaron Keener]], [[James Dragov]], [[Javier Kajika]] and [[Theo Parnell]].\n\nHowever, with Conley dead, and the Tanker lost, the Cleaners got scattered. Prior to [[Warlords of New York]], Conley gave some of her Cleaners to Henderson as a backup for her offensive against The Division in D.C.\n\nMonths later, the Cleaners had reorganized under new leadership, secretly receiving support from the Black Tusk who aided them in the creation of \"Purple Flame\", a highly corrosive flame that burnt through armor and defenses much faster. The Purple Flame was first tested during an attack on the Meret Estate, with a Hunter named [[Wright]] telling them that there was an outbreak of Dollar Flu there, though this was all a cover to recover [[Mackenzie Meret]] and bring her to [[Natalya Sokolova]]. However, the attack failed, resulting in the death of Wright and [[The Lovebirds]], alongside a sizeable number of Cleaners. \n\nIn the aftermath, under the leadership of high-ranking Black Tusk officer [[Richard Danvers]], who had taken Conley's place as leader, he enlisted the aid of [[Matthew Grant]], a VFX artist who used deep-fakes and broadcasted propaganda to spread misinformation about Aaron Keener and The Bridge Settlement. The Cleaners would establish a foothold in Brooklyn, securing multiple sites including an offshore refinery to produce purple flame. Agent Hoskins, a resident of the Bridge, would send out a message to request support from the Division Agents in D.C., with The Sheriff arriving soon afterwards, rescuing Doctor Kandel from being killed and securing One Police Plaza. \n\nThe Agents would proceed to systematically dismantle the Cleaners operation, eliminating multiple high-ranking individuals and a prototype Warhound named [[Violet (Warhound)|Violet]] alongside the destruction of their Purple Flame refinery and the loss of their deep-fake studio. In the end, Danvers would also be killed when his zeppelin was shot down by hijacked SAM turrets, once again depriving the Cleaners of their leader, while Grant escaped the Division's wrath during their assault on Army Terminal. It is unknown if Grant will take leadership of the Cleaners or pledge allegiance instead to Black Tusk. Though their Purple Flame refinery was destroyed, the Cleaners appear to have enough stockpiled to equip their remaining forces in Brooklyn. As of now, it is unclear if Danvers's death marks the end of the Black Tusk's collaboration with the Cleaners or if they will continue to work with them. {{Clear}}\n== Tactics ==\nWhen fighting Cleaners, agents should keep a distance from them, as most Cleaners are equipped with flamethrowers and can easily burn and kill with them. Using long-range weapons is recommended. If a member of the Cleaners is shot enough in the gas tank backpack, it will explode and damage them severely, or kill them depending on their level. However, not all Cleaners wear gas tanks such as Mechanics and Shields.\n\nThe Sweeper class will usually pin down their targets while another Sweeper rushes up to burn them. The Fumigators, being the Grenadier archetype, will lob incendiary grenades, and at higher levels (31 and 32), gas grenades at enemies in cover and will sometimes assist in pinning down the target. Mechanics will rush to cover when combat starts and will place a crude turret on top of the cover. Once the turret is down, the Mechanic will then engage with his Shotgun. If the Mechanic is killed, and the turret isn't destroyed, the turret will fire at enemies randomly until stopping, which it is then destroyed. Shield wielders will rush the target with a shield and fire axe, and won't stop until they are killed. Incinerators are rare, but they are the toughest enemy that can be encountered in Cleaner areas. They slowly shamble towards their target or will run-up to it if not close enough to attack. The flamethrowers they wield will have a pretty far range and can dish out a lot of damage in a single spew. Controllers used to be encountered only in the [[Amherst's Apartment]] and the [[Napalm Production Site]] missions, but since the Clear Sky update, they are now a more common sight - particularly in Search and Destroy missions and High-Value Target Ops.\n\nIn Tom Clancy's The Division 2, the Cleaners return. They are now even more skilled in guerrilla warfare, and particularly in building technology and producing fuel for their goals. Their tactics are much more aggressive and focus on co-ordinated offensives - their weapons may be makeshift, but these Cleaners are hardened guerrillas. Throwers appear to utilise a form of oil gas that is refined from crude oil retrieved from the stranded tanker, while engineers appear to use a crude oil variant in their turrets to form Napalm. However, they act rather similar, if not more aggressive. Assaults and Rushers are found on the front lines, utilising weaponry to keep their targets off balance. Engineers, Controllers, and Tanks are found at mid range, keeping the targets suppressed. Snipers are rare, but are formidable foes, utilising marksman rifles, shotguns, and a small RC car packed with explosives to knock a target out of cover. Ranged combat is recommended for Agents dealing with Cleaners, as much of their weaponry is useless at range. However, do not underestimate the range of a Cleaner napalm turret, grenade launcher, or flamethrower - they have a surprisingly long range and do serious damage. Extreme caution is recommended when entering Cleaner controlled territory - especially when weakened or underleveled, as Snipers can easily finish off weakened agents.\n\nWith the addition of Purple Flame in the Battle for Brooklyn, the Cleaners have become even more dangerous in combat, as their weapons now degrade agents' armor in addition to causing damage. The Purple Flame's effects have been added to all of the Cleaners' incendiary weapons (flamethrowers, turrets, Firebrand RC Cars, drone bombs, vapor grenades, etc.), making it even more important for Agents to keep their distance and destroy their weakpoints, which will remove their Purple Flame abilities across all archetypes. \n== Named Enemies ==\n{{Cleaner HVT}}\n\n\n== Relationship with other factions ==\n{{Quote|Come on. Don\u2019t cry. Die with some dignity.|A Cleaner Rusher, to a Peacekeeper hostage.}}\nAlthough it is never stated in-game and with little interaction (aside from skirmishes), the Cleaners would have most likely thought of the other warring factions as a detriment to their goal of cleansing the city of the virus as they would only get in the Cleaners way.\n\nIn regards to the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]], they believe the JTF are weak and soft and thus unable to handle the situation. Compared to them the Cleaners believe they are capable of making the hard choices and doing what needs to be done for the greater good. At the end of [[Dragon's Nest]], [[Roy Benitez]] admits he understands their intentions and goals but still views their methods as sick and twisted. He is also genuinely impressed and disturbed by their resourcefulness.\n\nAny animosity they have with the other factions would have likely been resolved by the time of [[Resistance]] as they joined forces with remnants of the [[Rioters]], [[Rikers]], and [[Last Man Battalion]] to combat the JTF and Division agents as well as to hunt down Aaron Keener.\n\nThey seem to hold a big grudge towards [[Black Tusk]] after being manipulated into believing that [[Vitaly Tchernenko]] was the one responsible for creating [[Green Poison]] and wanting revenge.\n\n\n== Weapons Used ==\n{{Cleaner Weapons}}\n\n\n== Cleaner Enemy Types ==\n=== ''Tom Clancy's The Division'' ===\n{{Cleaner Class}}\n\n\n=== ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'' ===\n{{Cleaner Class TD2}}\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nCleaner Assault TD2.png|Cleaner Assault\nCleaner Thrower TD2.png|Cleaner Thrower\nCleaner Sniper TD2.png|Cleaner Sniper\nCleaner Controller TD2.png|Cleaner Controller\nCleaner Engineer TD2.png|Cleaner Engineer\nCleaner Tank TD2.png|Cleaner Tank\n</gallery>\n\n\n===Concept Art===\n<gallery>\nYulia-misyul-9-1.jpg|Cleaners faction model art\nYulia-misyul-8-1.jpg|Cleaners faction model art\nYulia-misyul-7-1.jpg|Cleaners faction model art\nYulia-misyul-8-2.jpg|Cleaners faction model art\nThe-division-cleaners-annex-wallpaper-2560x1600.jpg|Cleaners faction model art\n548a725277d9263ad22e85dd46e2393c.jpg|Cleaners faction model art\nDWGgBOOXcAUPfhK.jpg\nDWI0lZ0VAAATFOG.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n===Other===\n<gallery>\nCleaners-Broadway.png|Two Sweepers at the Broadway Emporium\nSweepers-Hudson.png|A group of Sweepers at the Hudson Train Yards\nCleander Fumigator.png|A Fumigator and a Sweeper\nJoe Ferro.png|Joe Ferro, the leader of the Cleaners\nRC Firebomb.png|The RC Car used by Mechanics.

They have the abilities '''Incinerator Drone''', '''Firebomb''', and '''The Purifier'''. Their passive trait, '''Incendiary Rounds''', inflicts burn damage but decreases their weapon range. Joe Ferro also features as the faction's announcer.\n\n==Trivia==\nFor those who want to get a close look at a Sweeper, Fumigator, or Shield, play the Mission [[Napalm Production Site]]. When exiting the elevator to the hazmat area before the player(s) encounter [[Joe Ferro]], there will be a Sweeper and a Fumigator (a shield may spawn on harder difficulties) on the other side of a glass window directly to the left of the elevator. They will react to the player(s) in a sequenced animation, then runoff. Plotwise, this is the Cleaners discovering the Agent coming to kill Ferro, then running off to warn others (others being the first group of Cleaners that run downstairs on the left and right sides of the final room).\n*Despite being dedicated to burning out the virus, Cleaners are rarely seen anywhere near Contaminated areas outside of the Dark Zone.\n* Sometimes, when a civilian goes near a group of Cleaners, said a group of Cleaners will threaten them, if the civilian doesn't leave the area, the Cleaners will open fire and kill them.\n*Although the Cleaners' leadership and source of napalm have been eliminated, the leftover Cleaners seemingly have an infinite supply of it [napalm], although it's most likely for gameplay purposes.\n**A phone call collectible between two cleaners intending to produce napalm found mentions styrofoam as an ingredient, probably alluding that the napalm the cleaners are using is nothing more than a styrofoam/gasoline mixture, a low-grade easy-to-obtain variant.\n** A Scribble on a wall in the napalm production site which may possibly be by a cleaner, instructs how to make napalm by mixing equal parts gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate, which is a reference to the popular book Fight Club.\n*If the player purchases the Cleaner Faction bundle from the Premium Vendor, they will get the Shield outfit.\n*In the North American version factions trailer lines used for the cleaners is: \n**''\"These streets must be sanitized. To save our city, we must burn away this disease. Every trace of it. No matter the cost.\"''\n*For the European version of the faction trailer the line used is: \n**''\"These streets must be cleansed. To save our city, we must burn away this disease. Every trace of it. Only through the power of fire can we be free\"''\n*In ''Tom Clancy's Division 2'', ECHO revealed that not all cleaners were from a sanitize company, some were from EMT, in charge of Emergency Medical Treatment.\n*The Cleaners are similar to another enemy faction in their methods: The [[Outcasts]]. Both utilize homemade flamethrowers and mercilessly kill anyone and everyone and both leaders of their factions turned into murderous sociopaths after the death of their loved ones.\n**However, their goals are different. While the Cleaners seek to eradicate the virus through fire, the Outcasts instead seek to spread the virus and kill indiscriminately.\n\n[[es:Cleaners]]\n[[fr:Nettoyeurs]]\n[[ru:\u0427\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0438]]\n[[Category:Enemies]]\n[[Category:The Division]]\n[[Category:Factions]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:The Division Resurgence]]",

  "D.C. Dark Zones": "{{For|the Dark Zone in Tom Clancy's The Division|N.Y.C. Dark Zone}}{{Quote|The Dark Zone is a place for wolves and not sheep.|Description}}[[File:DC DZ.jpg|470px|thumb]]The '''Decontamination Zones of the District of Columbia''', colloquially known as the '''Dark Zones of D.C.''', are ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]'s'' version of the open Player Versus Player (PVP) zones with some Player Versus Environment (PVE) elements tied-in.\n\nThe Dark Zone is an untamed area of the map where any agents can go off the grid to do terrible things. The Dark Zone is also the most dangerous area in the game, where fear, betrayal, and tensions are high, as any other agent can turn against you and steal your hard-earned loot.\n\nThe Dark Zone is per design an area that provides many challenges. The NPCs you meet are brutal \u2013 but the biggest challenge has always been the other players. While the DZ used to have a lot of features to make the DZ more PVE player-friendly, with [[Title Update 8/Warlords of New York|Title Update 8]] many of these changes were reversed and the Dark Zone became more focused on PVP.\n\n==Dark Zone Story==\n[[File:DZ-West-The-Division-2-600x338.jpg|300px|thumb|Consequences of DC-62]]In the early days of the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]], the government attempted to eradicate the [[Green Poison|virus]]. When these attempts failed, they walled off the most contaminated areas to try to quarantine them. In these newly established Dark Zones, an experimental chemical was deployed to try to help. This chemical (named [[DC-62]]) was a massive failure, ending up being just as lethal as the virus. This left large areas of the Capital uninhabitable and caused many looters and factions to not risk entry. That meant that high-tier weapons and gear were left behind and are now up for grabs by anyone who is willing to enter. Unfortunately, some of this gear is contaminated and must be extracted to be cleaned before it can be used. Any agent who is nearby and has questionable loyalties may decide that they'd rather have the loot for themselves and go rogue in an attempt to claim it.\n\n{{Clear}}\n==Gameplay==\nThe Dark Zone is the only location in which players can roam solo or in a group in an openly PVP environment without limits. In the Dark Zone, players will be able to do challenges, landmarks, take down enemy faction bosses for loot. Similar to ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]], ''players will need to extract the contaminated loot before it can be used in the open world.\n\n=== Normalization ===\nIn the Division 2, the three Dark Zones in Washington D.C. utilize \"normalization\" to level the player field. Normalization reduces the peaks and valleys between players who have high survivability or high damage output. Normalization only affects Base Amor and Weapon Damage. AI are not exempt from normalization either; they adhere to the same normalization rules players do.\n\nMatchmaking in the Dark Zones occurs in two separate brackets. On the one side, players are matched in level buckets (1-10, 11-20, and 21-30) and normalized to the same power level. On the other side, all players who have reached World Tier are matched together and normalized to the same World Tier. For players above the normalized power level, bonus statistics are applied to reward you for your time.\n\n=== Going Rogue ===\nPlayers can choose to go [[Rogue Status/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Rogue]] to engage in PvP activities with other players.\n\n===Dark Zone Checkpoints===\n[[File:The-Division-2-Dark-Zone-Rain-Tom-Clancy-Gate.png|thumb|Dark Zone Checkpoint|300px|right]]Dark Zones now have DZ Checkpoints that are armed with automated turrets that guard the entrance of every Dark Zone, and they protect newcomers from [[Rogue Status/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Rogue]] agents or enemies.\n\n{{Clear}}\n===Invaded Dark Zones===\n[[File:TD2-BT-Sniper-Warhound-Assault-Heavy-Tank.jpg|thumb|Black Tusk faction|300px|right]]Once players reach [[World Tiers|World Tier 1]], Dark Zones will start becoming Invaded. The dangerous end-game faction [[Black Tusk]] will periodically move in one of the three Dark Zones and give you a challenge. \n\n{{Clear}}\n===Landmarks===\n[[File:Ambush.Division 2.png|300px|thumb|right]]As you explore the Dark Zone you will find [[File:Landmark icon.png|22px]] <font color=\"#714DB7\"><font color=\"#714DB7\">'''Landmarks'''</font></font>. These Landmarks can be special streets, stores, or just random abandoned buildings. These <font color=\"#714DB7\"><font color=\"#714DB7\">Landmarks</font></font> are spots where you find strong elite opponents and also named enemies that guarantee good loot-drops for one and usually guard one of the Dark Zone Chests.\n\n<font color=\"#714DB7\"><font color=\"#714DB7\">Landmarks</font></font> evolved over time. First, you just needed to clear them and later they got multiple waves. The <font color=\"#714DB7\"><font color=\"#714DB7\">Landmarks</font></font> also provide different challenges: Normal and Hard difficulty. \n\nWhen someone clears a <font color=\"#714DB7\"><font color=\"#714DB7\">Landmark</font></font>, you can see it on the map and you also get a timer indicating how long ago it was cleared. This way you know that a player should be in the area.\n\n\n===Extractions===\n[[File:Division-2-Preview-Shot-05.png|300px|thumb|right|Rogue Agent prepares the ambush]]The only way to permanently keep contaminated loot and Dark Zone resources from the Dark Zone is to go through the extraction process. Each Dark Zone has three areas where you can call an extraction. Any player or group member can call the extraction but only one group can call an extraction in such an area. If an extraction is called, a clear visible flair is fired and the players and NPCs in the area will be alerted to the extraction. You will have a clear countdown of how long it takes for the helicopter to arrive.\n\nWhen the chopper has arrived, another timer will start and every member of the group can attach the contaminated loot to the rope that is dropped. Other players/groups may also attach their loot to the cable and fill up the remaining loot slots (there are 4 slots).\n\nOnce the timer is over, the helicopter takes the contaminated loot away. After that, you can pick up the decontaminated items from any Stash. \n\nThis extraction process is for loot only; the player will remain in the Dark Zone and can continue their search for loot. \n\nIt's important to note that, until the helicopter has left, other players can cut the rope and drop all the loot that is attached to it, allowing anyone to pick it up again and steal it. So it recommended to remain at the extraction and wait until the chopper has left - because only then is your loot safe. \n\nCutting the rope will turn you [[Rogue Status/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Rogue]], so expect players to protect their loot when this happens.\n\n\n===Safe Rooms===\nInside each Dark Zone, you can find a [[File:Safe Room TD2.png|22px]] [[Safe Houses/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Safe Room]]. This Safe Room is personal to your group and can\u00b4t be entered by other players. This Safe Room has multiple exits that allow you to leave the place from a different exit. The Safe Room is easily recognizable thanks to the big circular marker on the wall. Once you enter the Safe Room, your ammo will be restocked as well.\n\n\n==Dark Zone Rank==\nPlayer progression is split between Player Level and Dark Zone Rank. While the Player Level defines your progression as a character, your health pool, and what weapon and items you can equip, the Dark Zone Rank is more like a rank system.\n\nDark Zone XP is earned via Supply Drops, completing or hijacking extractions, revives, killing [[Rogue Status/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Rogues]] or agents, or going {{Manhunt}} {{High-end|Manhunt}}. Basically some form of interaction with other players. Dying will cause you to lose some Dark Zone XP and potentially rank down. Currently, the maximum Dark Zone Rank is 50.\n\nThe Dark Zone Rank is also tied to the [[Dark Zone Perks]] that can be unlocked at the [[D.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]]. One Perk becomes available every 5 DZ Ranks and if you drop down in rank, those perks may become deactivated again.\n\n\n==DZ Supply Drops==\nThis is a returning activity from ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''. In regular intervals, you get a Dark Zone Supply Drop that will land somewhere in the Dark Zone. It will be guarded by strong NPCs and once you have cleared the area \u2013 you also need to claim the Supply Drop. When you claim it, you get the reward for the group or you can steal it for yourself and go [[Rogue Status/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Rogue]] in the process. Those Supply Drops will be broadcasted over the map, so all players will know if the Supply Drop is being or was claimed.\n\nSupply Drops can happen in [[File:Landmark icon.png|22px]] <font color=\"#714DB7\"><font color=\"#714DB7\">Landmarks</font></font> that are not active and the fights for these can feature multiple bosses or factions. This will not only raise the difficulty, but it will bring more variety into the game loop and makes the drops less predictable. Also, more bosses and factions mean a higher chance or contaminated loot, so fighting for these drops will be more lucrative.\n\n\n==Dark Zones Areas==\nEvery Dark Zone has their own distinct environment, landmarks, and challenges. There are different challenges every time the player plays in the Dark Zone.\n\n\n=== [[Dark Zone East]] ===\nLocated near the East Mall, Dark Zone East was a military-occupied area. An explosion at a containment storage containing [[DC-62]] led to massive casualties, forcing whatever was left of the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] and the volunteers to evacuate the area and lead to the area being walled off. The wall off attempt was successful.\n\n\n=== [[Dark Zone South]] ===\nLocated in Waterfront, Dark Zone South was the primary storage facility site for DC-62, as well as the back-up military base after DZ East was evacuated. A flood breached the vaults containing DC-62 and spilled it across the whole zone. The military and scientists within the zone were once again forced to evacuate and wall off the whole zone. \n\n\n=== [[Dark Zone West]] ===\nLocated in Georgetown, the town willfully allowed the government to come in and fumigate the town with DC-62, long before the lethal effects were fully known. The area was walled off shortly after the first few deaths of the toxin happened, and is now a \"ghost town\". \n\n\n==Dark Zone Vendors==\n[[File:DZ Vendor.png|thumb|300px|Dark Zone Vendor]] Outside of each Dark Zone's entrance is a '''Dark Zone Vendor''' who offers a rotating selection of items for sale, including at least one Dark Zone-exclusive item (barring [[Raids|Raid]]-exclusive {{Exotic|Exotic}} items); however, they will only accept payment in [[File:DZ_Resource.png|22px]]<span style=\"color:#714DB7\"> DZ Resources</span>. \n\n[[File:DZ_Resource.png|22px]]<span style=\"color:#714DB7\"> DZ Resources</span> can be obtained by deconstructing Contaminated items (requires extraction) or looting specific crates inside the Dark Zones (no extraction required).\n\nEach of the three Dark Zone Vendors have separate inventories. They will also buy items like other vendors, but only pay in [[File:E-credit.png|22px]] E-Credits.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nDiv2 DZ body4 Rogue.png|Concept art of a Non-Rogue Division agent and a Rogue Division agent exchanging gunfire between each other\nDiv21.jpg|Two Division agents entering a Dark Zone Checkpoint\nDiv22.jpg|A Division agent extracting an item in the extraction zone by helicopter\nDiv2 DZ body1 US.png|Concept art of a Division agent requesting for extraction whilst being protected by other two Division agents\nDiv2 DZ header.png|Concept art of Division agents standing around the entrance to Dark Zone South\nAmbush.Division 2.png|A Division agent in Dark Zone East getting ready to ambush a couple of enemies\nDivision agents in a deadlock.JPG|Division agents in the Dark Zone in a deadlock situation with other Division agents\nDZ-West-The-Division-2-600x338.jpg\nFile:EHkXJS7X0AEDzlB.jpg\n</gallery>\n==Trivia==\n* Prior to [[Title Update 8/Warlords of New York|Title Update 8]], Invaded Dark Zones were named Occupied Dark Zones, where gear normalization was deactivated. The update applied normalization to Invaded Dark Zones as well, meaning the only remaining difference in Invaded Dark Zones is the presence of Black Tusk.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[Category:Dark Zones]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:PvP]]",

  "Directive 51": "{{Infobox/Directive 51\n|image    = Directive-51-wallpaper-1920x1080.png\n|image1   = Presidential-directive-51-2007-signature.png\n|location = [[Washington, D.C.]] \n|signed   = George W. Bush|name=Directive 51}}'''Directive 51 '''is a presidential arrangement from 2007, that promises an assurance of specific rights in a catastrophic emergency. It was written and signed by President George W. Bush on May 4, 2007. This emergency describes a location independent incident that threatens the American people, infrastructure, environment and political functions.\n\nIf another operation like [[Operation Dark Winter|Dark Winter]] was conducted there is a possibility that an organization such as [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]] will be activated in order to not only restore government control but to also save of what remains of society.\n\nDespite Directive 51 being kept a secret, information about its existence was leaked, and reporters like [[Rick Valassi]] were actively investigating it.\n\nThe nonclassified elements of Directive 51 specify that, in the event of a catastrophic emergency, all governmental power will be transferred to the president, top advisers and a committee including: \n* '''Vice President'''\n* '''National Security Advisor''': senior aide in the executive office of the president, serving as the chief in-house adviser to the president on national security issues.\n* '''National Continuity Coordinator (NCC)''': the directive specifies that the assistant to the president for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism will be designated as the national continuity coordinator. The NCC would be tasked with ensuring the continuity of all \"national essential functions\" (federal, local, territorial, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations) through a National Continuity Implementation Plan (NCIP). \n* '''Continuity Policy Coordination'''\n* '''Committee (CPCC)''': the CPCC is to be responsible for coordinating the NOC's NICP. It's to be chaired by a senior director from the Homeland Security Council staff, designated by the NCD. \n\n== Centralization of Power ==\nPrior to Directive 51, a catastrophic emergency would have been handled according to the National Emergencies Act (NEA). The NEA allowed the president to declare a state of emergency, but also gave Congress the power to \"modify, rescind, or render dormant such delegated emergency authority,\" if it deemed that he'd acted inappropriately. \n\nHowever, Directive 51 effectively supersedes the NEA, through the appointment of the NCC, without any specific act of Congress authorizing the position. It also negates any requirement that the president submit to Congress a determination that a national emergency exists. \n\nFurthermore, the U.S. Constitution states that the three main branches of the federal government (executive, legislative and judicial) must be kept equal and separate, with no single branch coordinating the others. Under Directive 51, the executive branch effectively takes a leading role, coordinated by the president. \n\n\n== In Real Life ==\nDirective 51 also known as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Homeland_Security_Presidential_Directive National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive] was written and signed on May 4, 2007. The law also gives American citizen's specific rights in a catastrophic emergency. The law was signed after [[Operation Dark Winter]] also caused the collapse of society by creating a mock simulation of a smallpox outbreak in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and additional cases in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The directive is highly controversial as it allows a single branch of government to coordinate with the others.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nThe-division-directive-51-guide-678x640.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n* ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n* ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[ru:\u0414\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430 51]]\n[[Category:Content]]",

  "Drone (Skill)": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Drone}}The '''Drone''' is a piece of\u00a0[[SHD Tech|SHD Technology]]\u00a0which serves as one of the skills in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''. \n\nThe Assault Drone is an unmanned drone that affects specific targets with a variety of effects. Once drones are deployed, they hover in the air above the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Agent]] either waiting for additional input for location (Bombardier and Tactician), or automatically performing its job (Striker, Defender, and Fixer). \n\nDrones can be deployed once before they undergo a cooldown period. This period varies based on whether the skill was manually destroyed, was shot down by enemies, or the duration ran out. \n\n== Base values for the Drone at Level 40 ==\n{{Drone TD2}}\n\n\n== Tips  ==\n*The Striker Drone possesses a turret that inflicts continuous damage upon its target. This drone can receive remote orders from its controller to attack specific targets, or it will automatically target nearby enemies. \n**The Striker Drone's indicator lights are the iconic Division orange, and a miniature turret is attached at the bottom via an extension.\n*The Defender Drone is a defensive drone that protects its owner by utilizing an experimental microwave directed emitter. It attempts to deflect incoming bullets with microwave bursts, creating an invisible barrier. However, each bullet deflected reduces its duration, and it is incapable of defending itself from enemy fire. It can, however, be ordered to guard friends or other friendly skill items. The drone will deflect any bullet so long as it's able to, ranging from shots from a pistol to the cannons of a [[Warhound]], however, it cannot deflect explosive munitions like grenades or rockets. \n**The drone's defense is not 100% perfect and can only defend against attacks from one direction at a time (which is either anything in front of or to the back of the target). Additionally, the drone's slower speed also prevents it from reliably protecting a sprinting target.\n**The Defender Drone's indicator lights are baby blue, and the experimental microwave emitter is attached at the bottom via an extension.\n*This Bombardier Drone can perform a bombing run across a long area. The drone flies to an area designated by the Agent and drops a barrage of explosives as it strafes from one end of the zone to the other.\n**The Bombardier Drone's indicator lights are a light red, and the explosives are contained in a holder at the bottom of the drone.\n*The Fixer Drone repairs armor over time. You can choose whether you want it to fly next to you and passively repair your armor, or choose a friendly target whose armor needs repairing, including other damaged skills.\n**The Fixer Drone's indicator lights are bright green, and a special feeder is attached to the bottom of the drone via an extension.\n*The Tactician Drone is built for intel. This utility drone flies to maximum elevation at a location of your choosing and spots all hostiles within a certain radius, effectively highlighting their location. While deployed, it gives you and your party continuous information about the position of the enemies within your area. It acts very similar to [[Pulse]]. \n**This is the Specialist skill for the [[Specializations|Sharpshooter Specialization]].\n**The Tactician Drone's indicator lights are yellow, and a small radar and bird's eye camera is attached to the bottom of the drone.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nDrone 1.png|Striker Drone\nDrone 2.png|Defender Drone\nDrone 3.png|Fixer Drone\nDrone 4.png|Bombardier Drone\nDrone 5.png|Tactician Drone\n181108_hunter_gif_drone_01_660x371_h264_v4_gif_341118.gif|An agent deploying the Assault Drone\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n{{Weapon SHD Tech 2}}\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Skills]]\n[[Category:Abilities]]\n[[Category:SHD Tech]]",

  "Lower Manhattan": "'''Lower Manhattan''' is the main location of the [[Warlords of New York]] expansion. The area consists of 4 PvE zones and one [[Settlements|Settlement]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Prior to Warlords of New York ===\nDuring the initial outbreak, a large part of the Lower Manhattan region was turned into a Decontamination Zone (colloquially known as a Dark Zone, or DZ). As was standard with other Dark Zones, large walls were erected around the region, and travel to and from was minimized to [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents and [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] personnel.\n\nMonths after the outbreak, the Lower Manhattan Dark Zone had subsequently lowered in threat level. The JTF decided to reopen the Dark Zone and set up a Base of Operations in the New York City Hall and a trading post in Wall Street Stock Exchange; meanwhile, some civilians and former JTF had formed a settlement called [[Haven]], calling themselves the [[Peacekeepers]]. Lower Manhattan eventually became the safest place on the whole island ever since Midtown Manhattan became more volatile from hostile activity. However, the temporary peace that fell upon the city was shattered when Rogue Division agent [[Aaron Keener]] arrived, and organized a coordinated attack at the JTF and The Division.\n\n=== Events of Warlords of New York ===\nAfter the attack on the JTF headquarters in City Hall, [[Aaron Keener]] and his Rogue Lieutenants caused chaos in '''Lower Manhattan'''. [[Javier Kajika]] kidnapped, tortured, and killed many members of both the [[Peacekeepers]] and what [[JTF]] remained in the city with the help of the [[Cleaners]]. [[Vivian Conley]] led the Cleaners to shipwrecked oil tanker and used the supply to further produce fuel for their flamethrowers. James Dragov led the [[Rikers]] to take over the Stock Exchange, and ordered them to help protect [[Theo Parnell]]. Theo was the primary architect of the [[Rogue Network]], and completed it while stationed in Lower Manhattan. Agents are called in from both Washington, D.C. and the nearby area. These agents, notably including Agents [[Alani Kelso]] and [[Faye Lau]], wage a campaign against Keener and his lieutenants, culminating in a final showdown on [[Liberty Island]]. This battle ends with Aaron Keener dead, and the subsequent activation of the [[Rogue Network]]. After this, it is revealed that prominent Division Agent [[Faye Lau]] has gone rogue and sided with the [[Black Tusk]].

She's a tough, capable operative and field commander who wears a prosthetic leg after being shot in the leg by a [[Hyenas|Hyena]] sniper in combat during The Division's activation into D.C. and was saved by Agent [[Alani Kelso]] in early March.\n\nShe also lost her husband to the [[Green Poison|smallpox virus]], a slow death also witnessed by her young daughter. As a direct result, Sawyer grapples with dark impulses, including severe anger and PTSD.\n\nShe struggled on with administrative duties at the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]], but eventually relocated to the Theater, where she became the leader. She is fiercely dedicated to the rebuilding effort and will not hesitate to use or advocate violence to protect her people. \n\nShe has a daughter named [[Eleanor Sawyer|Eleanor]], who was kidnapped by the Hyenas. Eleanor was held hostage at the [[Grand Washington Hotel]] until being rescued by Division agents led by [[Alani Kelso]]. In return, Odessa promises to pay back her debts to her rescuers.\n\n\n==Personality==\nSawyer is ruthless and battle-hardened. However, she's also traumatized by the amputation of her leg and feels guilty about abandoning [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]]. She is loyal to those who help her out and is fiercely protective of her daughter.

Composed of the bitter [[Roosevelt Island]] quarantine survivors, they are hell-bent on revenge against society because they were placed in a forced quarantine that was poorly run and killed many. Their leader, [[Emeline Shaw]], believes everyone is complicit and urges her followers to punish the guilty by spreading sickness and murdering indiscriminately. They are notorious for their sadistic nature and religious-like devotion to their cause, which is reflected in their use of suicide bombers, Molotov cocktails, and flamethrowers. Their goals have even attracted those who weren't part of the quarantine on Roosevelt Island including those with law enforcement or military training.\n\nTheir\u00a0fanatical devotion to their ideals are somewhat\u00a0similar to the [[Cleaners]], and some Outcasts even utilize homemade flamethrowers that resemble the Cleaner's custom rifles. However, their goals appear to be the complete opposite of each other: The Cleaners wish to burn away all traces of the [[Green Poison]], regardless of what must be sacrificed in the process, whereas the Outcasts want to spread death, disease, and misery wherever they go,\u00a0seeking revenge against a society that let them suffer under the corrupt [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] soldiers that would later form the [[True Sons]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe Outcasts faction consists of the bitter survivors of a forced (and admittedly ill-advised) [[CERA]] quarantine on [[Roosevelt Island|Theodore Roosevelt Island]] and adjoining areas along the Potomac River. This murderous crew is bent on revenge against the authorities who confined them on the island, and the society that stood by and let it happen. Comprised mostly of locals drawn from many walks of life, Outcasts embrace an extreme nihilism. This in turn fuels a grim fanaticism that drives them to fearless aggression.\n\nAs the [[The Outbreak|smallpox outbreak]] spread out of control in January, CERA and local [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] authorities put a panicked, desperate plan for a forced quarantine into place. Soldiers cordoned off Theodore Roosevelt Island and sections of the eastern shore of the Potomac River (including the John F. Kennedy Center) from the rest of the city. Then [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] special units rounded up infected civilians from all hospitals and refugee camps and shipped them into the quarantine zone.  \n\nThe zone's hastily erected facilities turned into a living nightmare for both the patients and medical staff. CERA established a triage center in the JFK Center, with the inpatient housing area isolated on the river island. The name \"Roosevelt\" quickly became synonymous with \"death trap\" as deceased pandemic victims piled up in the island's makeshift morgue.\n\nUltimately, not everyone quarantined was infected, and not all of the infected died. Many Roosevelt survivors were severely traumatized by the horrors they were forced to endure. One woman, [[Emeline Shaw]], arose from their ranks and began to gather followers. Shaw, who had contracted the disease in quarantine and survived, was so consumed with rage that she organized a phalanx of \"carriers\" - people who, like her, had survived to become asymptomatic carriers of the smallpox virus. Her plan was to spread the disease to all as-yet-uninfected areas of the city.\n\nAccording to intelligence reports, her exact words were: \"None shall escape.\" \n\n\n== Formation of the Outcasts ==\n{{Quote|Our enemies are right across that river. They tore us away from our families. Locked us in here. Starved us. Deprived us. Assaulted and murdered us. But it's not just them. It's also the ones that signed the orders. Who decided this was an acceptable solution. And it's the ones - all the ones - who stood by and let it happen. Doing nothing.\n\nI want justice. And so I condemn them. All of them. And I will not rest until they are punished.|[[Emeline Shaw]] rallying the Outcasts at Roosevelt Island and declaring war against everyone in Washington, D.C}}\nIn her rage and grief over the loss of her daughter [[Savannah Shaw|Savannah]] and the horrors she and other refugees in [[Roosevelt Island]] had to endure, [[Emeline Shaw]] rallied them to form the Outcasts to take their vengeance against the [[True Sons]]. But it wasn't enough to take their war against them, so Emeline declared anyone as their enemy, including the civilians outside the island who were just trying to survive the [[Green Poison]] as she saw those civilians not standing up for the refugees as grave injustice that must be condemned. Furthermore, Emeline and some of the Outcasts were asymptomatic carriers, allowing the faction to use that to unleash the Green Poison on non-infected areas of the city.\n\nWith low level of JTF guards at Roosevelt Island, it didn't take long for the Outcasts to take over the island. And so, they would begin their reign of terror.\n\n\n== Reign of Terror ==\n{{Quote|You are accused of complicity. Of standing by as your neighbors, innocent of any crime or wrongdoing, were rounded up and forced into brutal isolation, starved and left to die... For your crimes, your lives are judged to be forfeit. |An Outcast judging a group of Theater civilians they captured before executing them}}As many people flocked to the Outcasts, they were indoctrinated to become nihilistic and aggressive warriors. They attacked anyone as well as terrorizing the [[Campus Settlement]]. At some point, [[Harlan Lloyd]], aka The Strategist, got reports of Colonel [[Antwon Ridgeway|Ridgeway]] being arrested by the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]], thus Ridgeway and his unit are the enemy and not the JTF. However, [[Emeline Shaw|Emeline]] ordered him to burn all the reports, believing that by controlling the narrative, it would keep the Outcasts stable and the truth would only cause disarray. Furthermore, Emeline believed by becoming monsters, they could inflict fear into their enemies, weakening them.\n\nThe Outcasts waged terror against their enemies indiscriminately, even capturing civilians for execution or using them as slave labor. They went as far as sending decapitated heads of their victims, knowing that by spreading their terror, it'll cause panic and fear among their enemies. With Emeline and some of their asymptomatic carriers, they used their blood to inject their forces with [[Green Poison]], using this to infect areas of the city and small civilian communities, engaging in bioterrorism.\n\n\n== Outcasts' decimation ==\n{{Quote|Those outside have sacrificed themselves for you. Prove that their sacrifice was not in vain!|[[Emeline Shaw]] in speaker broadcast, rallying the Outcasts against the Division's assault on Roosevelt Island}}\nBut the tide would turn against the Outcasts when the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] arrived to [[Washington, D.C.]] to take back the capitol. One by one, their operations fell by the Division as they lost [[DCD Headquarters]], depriving them the means of unleashing [[Green Poison]] to their victims. Moreover, the capture of [[Harlan Lloyd|The Strategist]] allowed the Division to take more direct action against the Outcasts. The Outcasts were also sent to [[Federal Emergency Bunker]], killing many Division analysts and agents except one, [[Maya Walsh]]. However, they'd be dealt another blow when agents were sent there to secure the node in the bunker and rescuing Maya.\n\nThey'd suffer a major blow when the Division assaulted their stronghold in [[Roosevelt Island]]. Many high-value individuals were killed by the agents and the boat that was to be used to evacuate [[Emeline Shaw]] was sabotaged and decimated. With the loss of Roosevelt Island and their operations, Outcasts were scattered, finding themselves at war with every faction in D.C, including [[Black Tusk]]. However, Emeline Shaw managed to escape the island during the Division's attack, rallying her people once more.\n\n\n== Death of Emeline Shaw/Kenly College ==\n{{Quote|As long one Outcast remains, we will survive!|[[Emeline Shaw]] declaring her Outcasts will endure even after her death, moments before being killed by Division agents at Manning National Zoo}}\n[[Emeline Shaw]] including some of her remaining inner circle and many Outcast forces settled in [[Manning National Zoo]], preparing to make their stand. When the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] learned of this, they sent agents to the zoo to eliminate Emeline once and for all. Many of the Outcasts would fall, including Emeline's inner circle. In her last stand, Emeline declared that her Outcasts would still survive as long one of them survives. Emeline was killed by the agents, putting her out of misery. Though, [[Alani Kelso|Agent Kelso]] predicted that the Outcasts would still endure despite the death of their leader.\n\nIt's also revealed in an [[ECHO]] intercepted by agents in Manning Zoo that Emeline used to go there with her daughter [[Savannah Shaw|Savannah]] as that place held a lot of sentimental value to Emeline.\n\nIn addition, the Outcasts established a base in [[Kenly College]], hoping to find new ways to launch an attack on [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] When [[Joint Task Force]] ([[Task Force Proteus]]) was investigating the area, they assaulted the squad, killing all of them but one: [[Jack Arnold]]. They looted the supplies which included: three military servers, communications jamming hub, encrypted radio headsets, 2 tanks of large chemicals, explosives, a type of combustible armor, and a [[Mobile SHD Server]]. They also captured Jack Arnold and forced her to do their work. Their plans involved launching a surprising and devastating attack on the Division and D.C.\n\nHowever, those plans were derailed as the Division sent agents to Kenly College to follow a distress call from Proteus, putting a stop to the Outcasts and their plans, rescuing Jack Arnold, and securing the Mobile SHD Server. \n\n\n== Rallied by Rogue Agents ==\n[[Emeline Shaw|Emeline]]'s last words were proven correct as Outcasts got rallied by many [[Rogue Agents]] in the wake of Rogue Network's activation, promising them a new cause and revenge against the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]]. [[Chadwick \"Neptune\" Brandon III|Neptune]] rallied their forces in West D.C, but they'd be scattered after his death. When [[Carter \"Hornet\" Leroux|Hornet]] and his Rogue Cell arrived, many Outcasts would join him from all parts of D.C, hoping to spread fear and panic through the [[Eclipse Virus]]. Unfortunately for the Outcasts, the Division eliminated major low-level leaders, the Rogue Cell, and Hornet, scattering the faction once again.\n\nWhen [[Bardon Schaeffer]]'s Rogue Cell emerged, [[Skyler \"Belfry\" Williams]] with the support of [[Black Tusk|B.T.S.U.]], recruited what remains of the Outcasts in the Northwest region of D.C to cause problems for the Division, so Black Tusk can wage a proxy war against the organization. But like before, Belfry was killed by the Division, scattering any Outcasts who survived. \n\nOutside of D.C, Rogue Agent [[Rowan O'Shea]] rallied the Outcasts in her mission against the Division. A cell led by Agent [[Brenda Wells]] alongside Agent [[Leo Fourte]] and newly recruited Agent [[Maira Kanhai]] were pursuing Rowan across the country to stop her. However, when Brenda's cell arrived in Saint Louis. the Outcasts used dirty bombs, showering the city with radiation. Nonetheless, Brenda and her cell managed to stop Rowan and eliminated her, as well as eliminating any Outcasts who joined her.\n\nThe dirty bomb attack on Saint Louis by the Outcasts devastated the city. But furthermore, it became a strong rumor among [[Black Tusk]] and [[True Sons]] forces during the events of ''[[Reign of Fire]]'', especially due to concerns of radiation. Natalya Sokolova used these rumors to distract the Division in their operation against [[Zachary \"Stovepipe\" Beattie|Stovepipe]].\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nWith the many losses the Outcasts suffered, they have mostly detoriated into small bands of loosely-organized bandits. Hoarding supplies, terrifying civilians, and generally a nuisance in [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] While they're still dangerous, they're no more dangerous as they were before.\n\nDuring the events of ''[[First Rogue]]'', the Outcasts would take over multiple locations in [[Downtown West]], prompting [[Aaron Keener]] to send [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents to push them out as part of his test. The agents retook [[Control Points|control points]] occupied by the Outcasts, as well as eliminating a large number of them including high-value individuals.\n\n\n== Intelligence Brief ==\n{{Quote|For only those who have suffered may decree the suffering of others!|Outcast Creed}}\nOutcasts would do anything to spread the disease and, just as important to their designs, a paralyzing fear of the disease. Simply put, the cult seeks to terrify, infect and kill everyone in the district. Recently, a [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] source acquired an internal declaration of the Outcasts' primary objective: \n\n''\"This city left us to die. We will not stop until everyone in it lies cold, sick, and dead: eradicated. Vengeance will be ours.\"''\n\nThus, the [[Roosevelt Island|Camp Roosevelt Island]] survivors have their sights set on gutting the population of the nation's capital - every citizen and public official, alt law enforcement and military personnel, local or federal. This includes all competing factions in the region, particularly their crosstown rivals, the [[True Sons]].\n\nThe Division's intelligence wing has compiled the following analysis of Outcasts culture: \n*They are vengeful fanatics who do not respond to reasoned negotiation. \n*Because their beliefs are essentially nihilistic, they have nothing to lose, and they fight that way. \n*Their seething sense of betrayal has spawned an intense hatred for every level of society. Hence, they operate without empathy.\n*They kill ruthlessly, fervently, even joyfully. \n*They favor inhumane methods of killing, especially burning. \n*They are experimenting with biological warfare techniques: contaminating wells with the virus, and deploying \"Typhoid Mary\" sleeper agents to infect communities.\nHaving suffered from their quarantine from the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] under [[Antwon Ridgeway|Colonel Ridgeway's]] administration, the Outcasts pursue only one goal; revenge. They seek to bring about calamity and destruction to those that wronged them and see any 'bystanders' as equally guilty for doing nothing but watching them suffer in Roosevelt Island. Their followers' zealous devotion to their leader and their cause, the usage of distinctive, if not, poetic titles by some members, and their leaders' religious guidance is among evidence to suggest the Outcasts is a cult. They might even see their revenge against the world as a crusade of sorts. Their irrational mindset, however, does not stop them from being sophisticated and thinking outside of the box. The Outcasts' usage of homemade weaponry and the diverse combat style is a testament to their unorthodox, yet effective ingenuity. They typically identify their territory with \"decorations\" of glass shards wrapped in caution tape and burning biohazard boxes with the Outcast symbol\u00a0as seen on the bridge to Roosevelt Island.\n\n\nWhen they were organized and had a designated leader, they were a high-level threat as they had begun to use biological warfare against The Division and [[Campus Settlement|The Campus]], and would launch concentrated attacks. They had also established multiple base of operations - Roosevelt Island being their primary base, but having bases at the [[Manning National Zoo]], and [[Kenly College (Expedition)|Kenly College]].\n\nBut after The Division's concentrated campaign against them, they lost all their operating bases, weapon supply, and leaders, making them a low-to-medium level threat in [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.,]]<nowiki/>however they maintained a surprising level of organization that was not seen among any other faction native to DC.\n\n\n== Relationship with other factions ==\n{{Quote|Rats, dogs, and shits with guns... welcome to D.C.|An Outcast on how Washington appears}}\nThe Outcasts despise the [[True Sons]] and mark them as the ones primarily responsible for the quarantine and treatment as they (as the [[Joint Task Force]] and under command of [[Antwon Ridgeway]]) were the ones who imprisoned them and left them to die in the first place. They have been known to attack the True Sons and execute any survivors. Despite this, they are not actively at war with the True Sons compared to the [[Hyenas]] and are more focused on terrorizing the [[Campus Settlement]], such as sending people infected with [[Green Poison]] to try and infect the settlement ([[DCD Headquarters]]), and attacking anyone who is affiliated with them.\n\nThey are hostile towards the Hyenas. However, an [[ECHO]] located on H Street NW, near the [[The World's End|World\u2019s End]] control point shows that the Outcasts and Hyenas are at least willing to temporarily co-operate while trying to take out a squad of True Sons that were guarding a building in [[Downtown West]], but will attack each other on sight otherwise.\n\nFollowing the death of Emeline Shaw, the loss of the strongholds Roosevelt Island and Manning National Zoo,\u00a0and the invasion of the [[Black Tusk]], the Outcasts are now at war with every faction and are trying for control of positions within [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]]\n\nAfter the fall of Aaron Keener and the activation of the Rogue network, multiple Rogue Agents attempt to make alliances with scattered Outcasts, promising an new cause to fight for. [[Chadwick \u201cNeptune\u201d Brandon III|Neptune]], along with his Cleaner support, allied with some remnants of the Outcasts in West D.C., led by The Silent (West End), The Plague (Foggy Bottom), and The Reckless (Constitution Hall). However, Neptune is killed by The Division, crippling the Outcasts in West D.C.\n\nWith the rise of [[Carter \"Hornet\" Leroux|Hornet]]'s Rogue Cell, the largest remnant of the Outcasts from all parts of D.C. joined his cause, seeking to profit off the fear and panic that would rapidly spread in the rise of the Eclipse virus. Most were rallied under the commands of [[Lori \"Termite\" Baker|Termite]] (Northwest D.C.), [[Tegan \"Luna\" Silver|Luna]] (Lower Manhattan), [[Elija \"Huntsman\" Le|Huntsman]] (East D.C.), and Titan (Southwest D.C.), or under Hornet himself. But with the death of all the major low-level leaders, rogue agents, and Hornet himself, the Outcasts scatter once again, deteriorating into small bands of roving thugs.\n\nFinally, with the emergence of Bardon Schaeffer's rogue cell, [[Skyler \"Belfry\" Williams]], with the support of the BTSU, recruits what remains of the Outcasts in Northwest D.C to cause problems for The Division in order for Black Tusk to wage proxy war on The Division. With the loss of Belfry, those that remained became aimless and disappeared back into the city once again.\n\nWith the loss of all major rallying leaders, the Outcasts have mostly deteriorated into small bands of loosely-organized bandits that attempt to hoard supplies, terrify civilians in their areas, and generally be a nuisance in D.C.\n== Tactics and Weapons ==\nOutcasts are generally as their name suggests - they are brutal, unfeeling killers and murderers that prey on a society that they feel had left them to suffer and die on [[Roosevelt Island]]. They are more suited to hunting and torturing unarmed combatants, however can stand their ground against more dangerous foes such as [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division agents]]. They consist of locals from varying backgrounds who have either survived the quarantine on Roosevelt Island or are sympathizers that joined the Outcast cause. As noted about their armament:\n\n* Outcasts have access to a wide variety of military and jury-rigged weapons of their own design.\n* Most weapons are older technology  secured through raiding, looting, stealing and killing. \n* Examples include Russian RPKs and AK-Ms, German MP5s, French FALs, and American M870s and M1911s.\n* However, most of their weapons are of a more limited selection due to their ill-disciplined fighting methods.\n*They also have a limited access to secondary equipment, such as WW2 Sling vests, hand torches, bandoliers, and fuel tanks.\n* For the most part they utilize jury-rigged weapons that are simple and easy to use.\n* Examples of this include the flamethrower, Molotovs, RC cars with sawblades, and other heavily modified civilian tech.\n* They have reckless and aggressive combat tactics, advancing close to the agent, discarding cover, or simply charging towards enemies.\n\nRushers should be the number one priority as their suicide bombs can be lethal. Heavy Weapons are a serious threat, especially on higher difficulties as their fire can chip away an Agent's armor incredibly quickly, however can be incapacitated by shooting their ammo belts. Outcast Supports should be priority targets if there are no Heavy Weapons or Rushers nearby, as they deploy incendiary round boxes. Tanks are their own target as they have strong armor and a dangerous melee attack, but are harmless at long range. Scorchers can be disabled by shooting their fuel tank, which makes their flamethrower useless and forces them to switch to a pistol. Snipers are dangerous to distracted agents, but can be distinguished by their glowing sight when they are aiming. {{Outcast Weapons}}\n\n\n== Named Members ==\n{{Outcast HVT}}\n\n\n== Archetypes ==\n{{Outcast Class}}\n\n\n==Quotes==\n===Combat===\n<tabber>Assault=\n*''Let's get some justice!''\n*''Fuck you, Agent!''\n*''Fuck the Division!''\n*''Fuck the System!''\n*''You want to live at their feet, or die standing?!''\n*''Taken way too many hits!'' - armor depleted\n*''Gonna need to keep my head down!'' - pressured\n*''Stop Shooting!'' - suppressed\n*''Shoot someone else, will ya!'' - suppressed\n*''You'll pay for your crimes!'' - Outcast dies.\n*''More blood on your hands!'' - Outcast dies.\n*''Another has fallen!'' - Outcast dies.\n*''We're a man down!'' - Outcast dies.\n*''Hey, are you okay?

One of the advantages of pistols is that they have an unlimited ammo supply.\n\nEach pistol comes with two talents, with the second talent being rolled with {{High-end|Expert}}, increasing damage towards enemies at low health.\n\nPistols do not carry any special class talent, with the exception of the {{Exotic|Golden Rhino}}, which gains increased threat.\n\n\n== Weapon Types ==\n*Semi-Automatic\n**Semi Automatics are reloaded and fed via magazines, the most variety when it comes to weapon modifications, and have the best stability and best range (in terms of Sidearms) but have lower damage. Most of the sidearms present in the game are Semi-Automatic.\n\n\n*Three-Round Burst\n**A sidearm that fires three bullets at a time; it does lower damage per bullet than a Semi-Auto but makes up for it in its number of bullets shot. The only Three-Round burst weapon is the [[93R]].\n\n\n*Revolvers\n**Revolvers are fed their ammunition in (as the name implies) their revolving chamber and are reloaded via a revolver speedloader. Revolvers lack in weapon modifications, capacity, range and stability, but make up for it for its high damage.\n***The only revolvers present in the game are the [[Model 686]] and the [[Rhino]] weapon line.\n\n\n== Sidearms ==\n{{Sidearms Division}}\n\n\n== Talents ==\n{{Sidearm Talents}}\n\n\n==Trivia==\n*When using a [[Ballistic Shield]], the player will use his equipped sidearm.\n**If using the {{Gearset|D3-FNC}} gear set, the player will instead use an [[Submachine Guns|SMG]], switching to the sidearm when it runs out of ammo.\n\n\n{{Nav/Weapons}}\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Sidearms]]",

The players take the role of Division agents.\n\nThey are fully autonomous field operatives trained to restore order to communities suffering from catastrophic events, institutional collapse, and societal breakdown. Division agents are embedded in society, leading ordinary lives until they are activated. The Division is not an elite unit in the traditional military sense. They are a civilian agency whose members do not train or deploy like military units. Elite military forces are trained for specific tasks with a completely different mission specification than that of The Division. The Division is made unique by its connection to [[Directive 51]] and its interconnected but autonomous networked organization. It is The Division as a whole that is special, not necessarily each individual agent. Officially, agents of The Division are counted as federal agents, in direct service of the United States federal government.\n\nTheir motto is: ''Extremis Malis Extrema Remedia (''Literal translation is \"''Extreme Evil, Extreme Remedy''\". More commonly translated as the proverb, \"''Desperate times call for desperate measures''\").\n\n== Origins ==\nIn 2001, two important events triggered further refinement of the Continuity of Government concept in the United States. In June of that year, federal agencies conducted a high-level simulation called [[Operation Dark Winter]] to test the nation's ability to respond to a widespread bioterrorist attack. The exercise featured a mock release of smallpox virus targeting Oklahoma City and two other locations in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The purpose was to evaluate national-emergency response protocols and the U.S. healthcare infrastructure in the face of such a lethal threat. \n\nThe results were sobering. Decision makers at all levels were remarkably unprepared. Woefully inadequate \"surge capacity\" in the healthcare system meant hospitals were quickly overwhelmed. According to the official post-exercise report, Dark Winter also exposed major \"fault lines\" between local, state, and federal authorities, as well as between public and private sector responders. Key agencies such as the National Security Council failed to determine the origin of the attack or contain the spread of the virus. Response times were too long, with a complex web of legal concerns slowing down logistics. Poor messaging and coordination with media outlets accelerated the panic, speeding the simulated transmission of the virus.\n\nSuch failures would likely produce devastating real-world consequences. The outcome scenarios included massive civilian casualties, large-scale breakdown of basic services, and widespread mob violence. Again, Dark Winter was just a simulation. But on September 11, 2001, a small band of armed terrorists with an improbable plan executed attacks that killed thousands of Americans, paralyzed the U.S. government, shut down the country's aviation grid for days, and deeply rattled the national psyche. As the 9/11 attacks unfolded, U.S. President George W. Bush fearing additional attacks, initiated COG measures and activated the old Cold War protocols. A reserve government, hidden in a secret location, was on constant readiness in case a decapitating strike wiped out federal leadership.\n\n\n== Presidential Directive 51 ==\nOn May 4, 2007, President Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive 51 ([[Directive 51|NSPD-51]]). This mandate claimed the executive power to invoke and direct Continuity of Government procedures in the event of catastrophic emergency. NSPD 51 construes such an emergency as \"any incident, regardless of location, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure, environment, economy, or government functions.\" \n\nThe unclassified portion of the directive was posted on May 9 to The White House website with little fanfare and no press briefing. But NSPD 51 also included a set of highly classified continuity annexes, undisclosed to Congress or the general public for what the executive branch deemed \"national security reasons.\" One of those annexes ordered the establishment of the Strategic Homeland Division. Created as a direct response to the [[Operation Dark Winter]] findings, The Division reports directly to the president and is tasked with maintaining order in extreme CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) environments in accordance with Continuity of Government plans. Once Directive 51 has been invoked, the president can activate The Division's highly trained corps of sleeper agents embedded across the nation and immediately commence operations.\n\nIn late 2014, an Ebola outbreak created a significant scare in Dallas, Texas. Misstatements on travel documents, misdiagnoses, and other mistakes led to two deaths and a rash of lawsuits. Breathless news reports fanned fears not just in Dallas but nationwide. The incident highlighted the fact that, despite more than $60 billion invested in bioterrorism readiness since 2002, the United States government still struggled to handle a small-scale viral outbreak... and was remarkably ill-prepared to handle a mass-contagion scenario. Also on stark display in the media coverage: how thin and precarious is the line that separates a well-informed public from mass hysteria.\n\nIn response to the Dallas events, the executive branch tapped into its top-secret \"black budget\" (estimated to be $80 billion per year) and reallocated significant funds to increase the operational readiness of the Strategic Homeland Division. In turn, The Division ramped up its covert recruitment and training activities.\n\n\n== Recruitment ==\nAgents of the Strategic Homeland Division are fully autonomous field operatives trained to restore order to communities suffering from catastrophic events, institutional collapse, and societal breakdown. Division agents are embedded in society, leading ordinary lives until they are activated. \n\nThe Division is not an elite unit in the traditional military sense. They are a civilian agency whose members do not train or deploy like military units. Elite military forces are trained for specific tasks with a completely different mission specification than that of The Division. The Division is made unique by its connection to [[Directive 51]] and its interconnected but autonomous networked organization. It is The Division as a whole that is special, not necessarily each individual agent.\n\nThe ultimate Division agent is loyal, versatile, able, and fit. A good immune system, a proven ability to think on their feet, and the mental fortitude to make the tough calls are essential. \n\nThey are pragmatic and direct, capable problem solvers with a natural curiosity and ability to take action.\n\nEvery Division agent is expected to possess a self-sacrificing, \"first responder\" mindset, one that places community above self. To this end, candidates typically have some background in community-oriented or protective services: healthcare, military, or law enforcement; security, rescue or intelligence work; or some combination thereof. But beyond this service preference, the Strategic Homeland Division seeks agents who come from all walks of life. \n\nField agents of The Division execute a wide range of tasks, both civilian and military in nature. They must be creative, versatile, independent, and capable of operating outside standard rules of engagement. As autonomous operatives, they are free to determine their mission priorities, operational posture, and level of visibility. Agents are bound only by their oath of service and regulated only by the Internal Affairs branch of The Division's Operations group.\n\nThe Division is granted priority access to a vast reservoir of restricted data on citizens collected by the United States intelligence community. This access lets Division recruiters identify a sizable pool of prospective agents with suitable backgrounds for service. Candidates are drawn from all aspects of society and are not limited to a specific skill set or profession. \n\nOnce a candidate has been targeted, a highly classified vetting process begins. Internal Affairs conducts a background check, including comprehensive financial and medical profiles, work history, and online tracking, followed by extensive active surveillance of the candidate and his/her social network. If the target's portfolio survives this meticulous preview phase, a seasoned Division agent finally makes contact to set up a preliminary interview. \n\nAt this point, the candidate must display a keen interest in national service and a willingness to accept absolute restrictions of secrecy - i.e., no one, not even spouse or family, can know about The Division. Then comes a rigorous round of follow-up assessments. Only when this pre-testing is successfully completed can the candidate finally be considered an official \"recruit.\" \n\n\n== Pre - Testing ==\nOnce a qualified and willing agent candidate is found, Division recruiters move to the next phase, called pre-testing. Agency psychologists conduct intensive personal interviews, administer cognitive and psychological assessments, and closely monitor performances in VR mission simulators that assess reactions to a wide variety of [[Directive 51]] scenarios. \n\nBased on the results of this testing, recruiters develop a comprehensive Candidate Evaluation Report for every prospective agent. On this report, recruiters measure the candidate's core skills by generating achievement scores for the following essential categories:\n*Loyalty \n*Mental resilience \n*Judgement and decision making\n*Field leadership \n*Adaptability \n*Problem solving and ability to improvise \n*Technical skills/aptitude \n*Commitment to peak physical fitness \n*Immune-system health \n*Raw survival instincts \n\nMental strength is even more important than physical strength because at the end of the day, survival and crisis management is a mind game. While not all candidates have actual combat experience, every agent must exhibit the aptitude to train and prepare for the worst case imaginable. \n\n\n== Training ==\nRecruits who pass pre-testing begin full physical and technical readiness training. Bringing a new Division agent up to mission-ready status can be a tricky endeavor, however, given the agency's secrecy requirements. The process is intensive and highly demanding, yet it must not put trainees in situations that arouse suspicion or threaten to compromise their cover. Therefore, most training activities are folded into a recruit's day-to-day life, cleverly disguised as common civilian pursuits. \n\nExamples: Unarmed lethal combat instruction may be billed as an exclusive \"black-belt-only class\" at a neighborhood martial arts studio. Fitness regimens may be high-intensity \"gold-level workouts\" at a local cross-training gym with special instructors (who happen to be Division trainers). Agents might register for advanced firearms classes at a nondescript shooting range, or enroll in \"continuing education\" technology courses at their local community college\u2014again, all taught by Division experts and attended only by other recruits or active agents. The Division works with every agent to develop effective, credible cover stories for these activities. \n\nTo further protect The Division's clandestine status, new agents are brought into The Division's fold slowly. During the first six months of training, each recruit is reevaluated weekly for progress, including mental strength and psychological stability. Most recruits train under top-tier operatives for nearly a full year before becoming privy to The Division's true purpose and mandate. \n\nSuccessful trainees eventually earn top security clearance, and are certified by Internal Affairs as active field agents. However, training continues year-round for the entire length of an agent's service in The Division. During peace time, all agents maintain and improve basic skills - survival, combat, CBRN\u2014knowledge, intelligence gathering\u2014through regular practice and exercise. The principle behind this concept of service has active members devoting non-work hours to training and preparation. To this end, the Division's Support department contracts civilian instructors to provide specialist training and conduct advanced group exercises of varied scope each year. In addition, each local cell of sleeper agents is encouraged to coordinate and conduct regular, self-directed exercises and training sessions as they see fit. \n\n\n== Embedding ==\nOnce the initial training is complete, new Division operatives simply continue on with their daily lives, functioning as normal members of society. Adapted from the concept of the \"stay-behind\" project enacted by the CIA during the Cold War, agents live where they will operate once activated, negating the need for centralized mobilization and redeployment. Since Division agents are drawn directly from and embedded into the society they will protect, they can be spread out across the country. Until activated, agents work in a wide variety of regular civilian jobs - police, paramedic, software engineer, lawyer, teacher, corporate manager - jobs that give them local insight and inform their tactical decisions in a crisis. They could be your neighbor, your office co-worker, your doctor, or your yoga instructor. \n\nBeing \"embedded\" this way can be a challenging experience, particularly for any agent with a close network of family and friends. Again, both The Division's existence and the agent's status must remain ironclad secrets, kept even from loved ones. As noted, this is made trickier by the agency's requirements for ongoing training and personal development. \n\n\n== Structure ==\nOn the organizational chart of the U.S. federal government, the Strategic Homeland Division is formally listed as part of the Department of Homeland Security. However, The Division reports directly to - and only to - the president of the United States. The Division may commence field operations only when activated by the president pursuant to [[Directive 51|National Security Presidential Directive 51]].\n\nLed by a board of directors, the Division's internal organization is decentralized, based on the assumption that a major disaster or attack could neutralize a single central facility. To avoid such a decapitating strike, the \"Rule of Three\" is applied: the agency's headquarters are housed in three identical and independently operated bunkers called \"Cores.\" Located in Texas, Kansas, and South Dakota, these Cores are deliberately redundant and distributed across the nation's heartland to better ensure survivability in case of catastrophe.\n\nEach Core is configured to handle routine management and administrative duties during peacetime but can transition instantly after a Directive 51 activation to coordinate intelligence and logistics across The Division network. Each Core is managed by a director with a seat on the board. \n\n\n== Departments ==\nThe Division features three separate departments: Research & Development, Support, and Operations. \n\n*'''<u>Research & Development (R&D)</u>''': The Division's R&D department builds and supports high-level technical solutions for all agency field personnel. Responsible for the development of proprietary SHD technology - internally referred to as \"[[SHD Tech|Shade Tech]]\" - the R&D group also maintains the agency's arsenal of weapons, field equipment, and custom tac-ops gear. To retain its covert status (and avoid intrusive political oversight), Division R&D operates out of a consortium of dummy companies. This branch is always active.\n*'''<u>Support</u>''': The Division's Support group handles routine tasks related to organizational management such as communications, finance and human resources. However, Support also performs key mission-critical functions such as intelligence analysis and logistical planning. Basic office administration functions are always active, whereas mission support activity ramps up only after a [[Directive 51]] invocation.\n*'''<u>Operations</u>''': The Operations department coordinates the deployment and field work of its cadre of highly-trained sleeper operatives known as \"agents\". Division agents are embedded in civilian communities across the United States. Other than top-secret covert training exercises agents do not engage in field work until Directive 51 is invoked and the president of the United States activates them. Operations is divided into three branches: Internal Affairs, Strategic, and Tactical.\n\n\n== Activation ==\nWhen the president invokes [[Directive 51]] and activates The Division, a first wave of agents emerges from sleeper status. This alpha team mobilizes at a designated rally point for insertion into the hot zone.\n\nOnce activated and deployed, a Division agent formally outranks all other tactical units in the field. This superseding authority lets Division teams cut through red-tape and bypass policy restrictions, laws, regulations, and jurisdictional boundaries as needed. Agents can freely organize local assets, civilian or military, to address local needs. \n\nOnce activated, The Division's primary task list includes the following: \n*Restore civil order and prevent societal collapse. \n*Facilitate restoration of basic services such as power, water, communications, and medical care. \n*Interdict acts of insurrection, rebellion, or lawlessness. \n*Provide tactical direction and support for local police and military units.\n*Collect field intelligence for key decision makers.\n*Rescue, protect, and/or provide safe escort for high-priority individuals. \n*Procure, protect, and disburse critical supplies: food, water, fuel, medical, and military.\n*Conduct robust counterterrorism operations. \n*Coercive operations against certain actors of violence. \n*Operations to control violence toward other actors who are not identified and can oppose a search for a solution. \n*Humanitarian operations in favor of the populations. \n\n\n== Activation & Deployment ==\nThe official \"call to action\" for Strategic Homeland Division agents unfolds in two phases: activation and deployment. Once activated and deployed into the field, Division operatives answer directly to the President of the United States (as mandated by [[Directive 51]]) and outrank all other federal and state actors. \n\nTheir primary tasks are to observe the effects of the crisis; relay those observations to key decision makers in the federal command structure; protect what remains of civilized society, including social institutions as well as physical infrastructure; and prevent additional damage by engaging rising threats. \n\nAccording to Presidential Directive 51, the President of the United States can mandate activation of the Strategic Homeland Division in the event of any catastrophic emergency. Directive 51 officially defines such an emergency as \"any incident, regardless of location, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure, environment, economy, or government functions.\"\n\nThe [[CERA|Catastrophic Emergency Response Agency]] defines a catastrophic emergency this way: \"A large-scale event with complex, far-reaching consequences that persist over the long term. Societal infrastructure is damaged or destroyed.\" The agency goes on to characterize such an event with a list of specific effects: \n*Most or all community structures are affected, including emergency response facilities.\n*Local response is compromised or fails due to the loss of personnel and/or facilities. \n*Aid to the region is not possible because all neighboring areas are affected. \n*Everyday community functions are totally interrupted. \n*Destruction of local and regional infrastructure means national government must take charge\u2014if is still intact and able to do so. \n\nMost scenarios that fall under this definition of catastrophic emergency are straightforward in nature:\n*Nuclear attack\n*Invasion by a foreign power\n*Large-scale terror event - e.g., bioweapon or radiological attack in alpha-level city\n*Natural disaster\n*Pandemic\n*Overthrow or seizure of the state apparatus by coup d'etat\n\nThese categories certainly cover most events that typically would be considered \"catastrophic\": a major earthquake or hurricane; an ocean-basin tsunami (rated as \"devastating\" at 9 or higher on the 12-point intensity scale); a nuclear exchange; a killer flu pandemic; a \"dirty bomb\" detonation; a full-scale foreign invasion; or a military coup triggering a widespread breakdown of institutional authority. \n\nIn the case of the [[Green Poison]] attack on Black Friday, the catastrophe marks the convergence of two scenarios: a terror event (category A bioweapon) that expands into a widespread smallpox pandemic. \n\n\n\nActivation can roll out in two ways: either as an incremental effort, where the response is gradually ramped up in waves over time as a crisis intensifies; or it can be a synchronized call-to-arms, summoning all available operational assets at once.\n\nEvery Division agent recruit who successfully completes field training and achieves active-duty status is issued an [[Smart Watch|SHD SmartWatch]]. The wear-able device is a touchscreen PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and communications relay linked to a powerful transceiver worn on the agent's backpack. This digital gearset connects the agent to the Division's encrypted, satellite-based worldwide network. \n\nWhen catastrophe strikes, The Division rallies its embedded forces via the network. The global-matrix SHD Network features guaranteed, instant and ubiquitous access to all SmartWatch devices. No matter where they are, Division agents receive their activation orders as a coded emergency signal that lights up their watches orange. The watch retains this orange glow until after the agent is killed or deactivated.\n\nActivated agents gain immediate access to high-tech equipment and advanced weaponry stashed securely in secret local caches. When activation is signaled, agents must drop whatever personal task is at hand and proceed immediately to the nearest Division armory to gear up.\n\nOnce fully equipped, Division agents head to either a predetermined rendezvous site or a tactical location designated in the activation orders. In either case, the agent's SmartWatch guides him/her to the targeted location via augmented reality (AR) markers seen in the heads-up display (HUD) in the agent's special [[Contact Lens|ScanTek]] contact lenses. \n\n\n== The Division deployment plan: A.N.S.W.E.R. ==\nOnce Division agents arrive at their designated destination, the first objective is to resolve local aspects of the catastrophic crisis scenario. Every field agent is always green-lighted to operate with full autonomy, free to prioritize urgent needs according to their training and rules of engagement. But agents typically look to seize the initiative in accordance with the Division's flexible deployment plan. This plan is called A.N.S.W.E.R., an acronym that stands for the following:\n\n*'''<big>A</big><small>CTIVATION</small> '''- The number of Division assets activated is based on the nature of the disaster and its current status. When activated, agents may receive further direct orders. But in most cases, they are expected to assess the situation and then either proceed to the next step of the A.N.S.W.E.R. protocol or take initiative and follow an autonomous course of action.\n\n*'''<big>N</big><small>ETWORK</small>''' - The Division's first and foremost post activation task is to secure its [[SHD Network]], the lifeline that allows all Division echelons to share critical information for long-term operations. While Tactical Division agents establish the network's functionality and generate the raw field intelligence, a highly trained team of Strategic SHD analysts process and present a daily briefing to key individuals within the government. Big-city mayors, state governors, on up to the president and his cabinet - all key elected officials and decision makers rely on Division intel to make sure all operational responses are based on a true and shared picture, as reported live in the field.\n\n*'''<big>S</big><small>ECURE</small> '''- Once the SHD Network is operational and intelligence is flowing, the deployed Division team typically takes up a defensive posture to secure the immediate area and establish a safe and stable Base of Operations. Once a base is in place, The Division can more easily interdict ongoing hostile activity and safeguard what remains of the locality's key assets. This includes protecting critical infra-structure (bridges, roads, tunnels, water supply, electrical grid), evacuating endangered officials and civilians, and clearing out hazardous areas. Again, the freedom and power provided by [[Directive 51]] means that agents can move about unhindered and outrank all other officials in the field.\n\n*'''<big>W</big><small>ATCH & EXPLORE</small>''' - Once the local civilian population, leadership, and public infrastructure is secured, Division agents may then push out further into the field. Standard procedure is to explore the scope of the disaster, observe the extent of social disruption, and formulate offensive operations against predatory or hostile groups.\n\n*'''<big>E</big><small>NGAGE</small> '''- In situations where laws, jurisdictional matters, or rules of engagement might hold back other law enforcement entities, Division agents are authorized to resolve problems directly and, if necessary, with extreme prejudice. As soon as a threat to the nation or its people is detected, The Division may engage without hesitation or restraint.\n\n*'''<big>R</big><small>ECOVERY</small> '''- Once an area is secured, recovery efforts begin. The Division coordinates intelligence, security, and advisory aspects of this work while leaving the hard labor to other departments and agencies.\n\n\n== Field Operations ==\nThe Strategic Homeland Division's organizing principles on the ground are flexible and modular. Agency field tactics are based on the core doctrine of \"autonomous action\" - that is, every Division agent is trained to operate independently in worst-case-scenario environments with little or no direct support. However, agents also receive extensive training in small-group tactics, and often deploy in teams. A cooperative team of agents is referred to as a \"cell.\" \n\nWhen working cooperatively, agents typically deploy in cells of up to four members, often supported by a remote-operated drone. Cellmates know each other well. They tend to train together and even socialize in their civilian life; they're familiar with one another's tactical and personal tendencies.\n\nAs always, the underlying strength of any cell is the fact that it lives in the area where it operates. Not only are cell members already in place when the disaster strikes, but they're familiar with the local utilities grid, know the lay of the land, and have a good take on people, places, and potential problems. \n\nHowever, cells generally have limited awareness of other agents or cells operating in the field, even in the immediate area. Maintaining such strict unit compartmentalization may seem counterproductive, but preserving tactical autonomy in this way helps keep The Division resilient and less sensitive to outside disruption. \n\nNo predetermined rules dictate how cells self-organize and operate. Some choose to assign complementary roles - e.g., forward recon units supported by suppressive fire and a medical expert; or close-range specialists wielding shotguns supported by long-range marksmen with sniper rifles. Other cells feature more flexible roles, with members switching functions on the fly as new situations dictate. In a crisis expected to be fluid and unpredictable, tactical decisions like this are left to each cell based on its mix of expertise, training, temperament and wits. \n\n\n== ISAC and The Network ==\nAccess to the [[SHD Network]] is one of the most important tactical tools in any Division agent's toolset. Every field operative is linked via his/her personal Intelligent System Analytic Computer ([[ISAC]]) to the agency's powerful distributed computing network. System output is routed globally through an array of dedicated, hardened intel satellites in geostationary orbit. Thus, lack of network access is rarely a problem. \n\nThese sophisticated networked systems automatically track and record every Division agent's progress, logging every encounter and generating field data to create a shared picture for informed analysis at all levels of the COG decision-making apparatus. \n\nOne of the SHD Network's most critically important tactical functions is to provide Division agents with timely identification of units during field encounters. Linked via [[Smart Watch|SmartWatch]] to the agent's [[Contact Lens|ScanTek]] contact lenses, ISAC draws from network databases to generate a nearly flawless, color-coded Friend or Foe (FoF) recognition system. This system displays the affiliation and current status of units directly onto the agent's HUD. In the rare instance when the network goes dark and the FoF system does not work, agents are reminded to proceed with extreme caution. \n\n\n== Rules of Engagement ==\nThe Strategic Homeland Division's directives specifying the circumstances and limitations under which its field teams may compel compliance by unwilling or resisting subjects, interdict actions by destabilizing players, or engage outright hostile organized forces in combat are broad by design and purposely nonrestrictive. \n\nDivision agents are not bound by any local use-of-force continuum or policy. They cannot be held accountable by local, state, or even federal laws or authorities based on any legal standards other than those delineated in the continuity annex of [[Directive 51]]. In other words, nobody has the authority to stop or interfere with a Division agent in the field other than another Division agent.\n\nWhile agents may compel assistance, coordinate joint response efforts, resolve conflicts or jurisdictional disputes between law enforcement and/or military entities, and demand free passage, they cannot usurp control of entire agencies or functions. \n\n\n== Tactics ==\nTactics are the individual actions undertaken to achieve a specific objective. This is distinct from the term \"strategy,\" which refers to an overarching plan or roadmap. A common explanation of the difference is that strategy focuses on a long-term goal while tactics are the short-term steps you take to achieve that goal. Example: Terrorists seize control of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California and shut down the core coolant systems in both reactors. This knocks out the regional power grid and threatens to trigger a catastrophic meltdown that will spew deadly radiation plumes over the entire southland region. \n\nYour Division cell's \"strategy\" is to infiltrate the plant and get it back online. Your \"tactics\" are the specific moves made to accomplish each objective - flank and neutralize enemy snipers overlooking the entrance; infiltrate a utility room full of hostages via ceiling ventilation ducts; toss flash-bang grenades to distract the hostage-takers then free the plant engineering team; escort the team to the main power control room; disarm a terrorist booby trap on the control console; and finally, set up a crossfire kill-zone to hold off hostile reinforcements as the engineers get the reactor coolant towers operational again. \n\nThe Division's approach to tactical execution is unique in that its philosophy and training methodologies offer no standard operating procedures in this regard. Tactics vary greatly from cell to cell, depending on team composition and skillsets, equipment available, and objectives. Initiative, flexibility, and improvisation are often the only common denominators between cells and their tactics. \n\nThat said, Division agents traditionally focus on developing expertise in all three basic tactical postures: offensive, defensive, and support. But after developing baseline skills in each posture, most agents begin to specialize in one area. When a local cell forms, the agents' various skillsets are often blended into a unique tactical team orientation. This gives the Division an evolutionary resilience as its cells respond to catastrophic situations. \n\n\n== The Go-Bag ==\nStrategic Homeland Division agents are carefully selected, highly trained, and endowed with the statutory authority to operate essentially unchecked by other agencies in the field. But any enforcement agency seeking to restore order amidst catastrophic disruption also needs the best equipment that modern technology can provide. The Division may be small in terms of manpower, but its arsenal of custom-crafted firepower, anti-ballistic body armor, and networking technology is a significant force multiplier in any hostile arena. A fully equipped Division agent is a fearsome, self-contained combat unit, battle ready. \n\nPreactivation, Division agents go about their normal civilian lives. But when the [[Directive 51]] call to duty comes, every activated agent has a two-hour window to report to his/her designated rally point. This puts a critical emphasis on readiness, both physical and psychological. Division agents spend months preparing to move very, very quickly at a moment's notice.\n\nThe first important component of readiness is the diligent maintenance of a \"Go-Bag\". Every agent must keep a Division-issue, armor-lined backpack stocked with a small arsenal of weapons and enough basic supplies to last a minimum of seventy-two hours in the field. This includes food, water, medical items, ammunition, protective equipment, tools, gas mask, Mylar space blanket, and other basic mission-essential equipment.\n\nDuring training, Division agents develop an individualized expertise in determining their own needs, and tailor the content of their Go-Bags accordingly. Agents also learn to keep a sharp eye out for loose materials in the field that can help them craft upgraded weapons and equipment. Generally, anything (wire, duct tape, electronic parts, even bits of fabric) that can help an agent make, repair, or customize equipment in an emergency environment is good for the go-bag.\n\nAfter activation, the Go-Bag is the Agent's lifeline, kept close at all times. Much of the gear in the bag is multi-purpose, intended for extended use, and designed to enhance mobility and autonomous movement. For example, instead of stocking bottles of water, most Go-Bags include water purification tablets and a purification bottle or straw. This lets the agent consume water in the field without adding significant carry weigh: relying on logistical resupply.\n\nOne critically important Go-Bag item, particularly in a pandemic environment, is the agent's supply of field medications. All Division agents undergo a full regimen of vaccinations, referred to as \"the Cocktail,\" upon officially joining the agency. The composition of this regimen can vary, depending on previous inoculations. For example, former military personnel who've served abroad have received much of the Cocktail already and need only a few booster shots. But the Division's field teams also gain priority access to the latest antiviral medications. Combined with protections from the Cocktail, these cutting-edge field meds make agents considerably more resistant to new diseases - even ones like the weaponized ''Variola Chimera'' virus that have no functional vaccine or cure yet discovered. \n\nEvery Division agent is encouraged to carry extra water, food, medical kits, and other survival items in their Go-Bag for disbursal to civilians in need. Distributing supplies in this manner is proven to be one of the most effective population control methods in a catastrophic emergency. \n\nPart of every Division agent's operational efficacy within a chaotic emergency environment is the ability to function in a fully independent manner - that is, to deploy into hotspots with no reliance on backup or logistical support. To support this radical autonomy, Directive 51's continuity annex grants every Division agent the freedom to procure any item from any location, without restriction, as long as said item is not currently in the direct physical possession of a civilian or friendly unit. This legal right of procurement overrides all local anti-looting laws. No restrictions related to the collection of private property shall apply to Division agents, no matter the jurisdiction. Given this dispensation, all Division agents are trained to seek, recognize, and procure valuable operational items from the field. This includes clothing items; the refreshment of an agent's wardrobe has great hygienic value in an infectious environment\u2014much like how soldiers regularly don clean socks on the battlefield to mitigate various immersion foot syndromes (such as trench foot) and other diseases. \n\n\n== Protective Equipment ==\nEvery Division field-operations team must be able to absorb damage as well as inflict it. Whether a team's tactical maneuvers are offensive or defensive in nature, aggressive or conservative, the odds are good that at least one agent will take a bullet at some point during a given mission. To ensure survivability in hostile emergency situations, the Division issues a basic set of rugged protective wearables. However, agents are also trained to scour every environment for items that can be used to upgrade or outright replace their current equipment selections. \n\nDepending on an agent's background and preferred method of engagement, the nature of protection chosen and its purpose can vary. All agents carry some form of mask for protection against dust and CBRN contaminants. Most agents wear some type of body armor, plus protective gloves and kneepads. Some carry advanced ballistic or melee protection shields, or deployable cover. They also carry means to identify themselves as government officials - to avoid trouble with other agencies and departments. \n\n*[[Body Armor]]\n*[[Masks]]\n*[[Gloves]]\n*[[Backpacks]]\n*[[Knee Pads]]\n*[[Holsters]]\n\n\n== Weapons ==\n{{Main|Weapons}}\nEvery Division field agent carries an inventory of weapons, typically with three firearms secured externally for quick access in tactical engagements: one holstered sidearm (pistol, revolver, or sawed-off shotgun) plus one primary and one secondary weapon (rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or submachine gun). An agent's selected weapons must be easy to carry, powerful, and adaptable to a wide range of scenarios.\n\nIt is important to note that The Division is not a \"regular\" fighting force. Division agents do not carry standardized weapons like their counterparts in law enforcement and the military. Their weapons are highly customized, modified by each individual agent to their exact personal specifications. For group tactics, Division field teams often coordinate their arsenals internally for optimal use, but beyond that, anything goes.\n\n{{Nav/Weapons}}\n\n\n{{Nav/WeaponsDiv2}}\n\n== Base of Operations ==\nIn military terms, \"logistics\" is the organized movement, housing, and supply of units and equipment. [[Directive 51]]'s mandate that Strategic Homeland Division operatives be \"independent and autonomous\" means that agents must be prepared to conduct field operations without even basic logistical support. \n\nIf there is no functional administrative infrastructure or safe zone in the designated operational area - including such fundamental survival priorities as reliable water sources, food, shelter from weather, or safe supply storage - then Division agents must create one by establishing a base of operations. \n\nThis base is an area or facility with a secure perimeter, caches of supplies and weapons, and (if local forces are available) a defensive garrison. Civilian, technical, and medical personnel can also be included in the base to facilitate an efficient response. It can include a field hospital, helipad, machine shop, or other facilities, and can be expanded and upgraded to address local needs. \n\n\n=== Base Types ===\nOverall, the base's logistical posture can vary depending on its location, situation and resources available. The site can serve as a Base of Operations (BOO), defined as a strategic, permanently manned, well protected facility with multiple structures or nodes used to support deployed forces, often with robust sea and/or air access. An example would be the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|James Farley Post Office]] complex in [[Manhattan Region|Midtown Manhattan]] or [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] during the [[Green Poison]] crisis. Or a site can serve as a Forward Operating Base (FOB), a contingency tactical location that is less secure but provides improved reaction time to local hotspots. A typical FOB has a fortified Entry Control Point (ECP) plus a mixed assembly of concrete barriers, barbed wire, bunkers, watchtowers, or other force-protection infrastructure. \n\nBeyond constructing larger bases, Division field agents also actively seek to establish a network of designated [[Safe Houses]] throughout unsecured areas. These facilitate not only Division field operations but also provide support for [[Joint Task Force]] missions as well as [[CERA]].\n\n\n==Known Division Agents==\n{{SHD Characters}}\n\n\n== Role in Tom Clancy's The Division ==\n==== The First Wave ====\nIn response to the burgeoning anarchy in wake of the [[Green Poison]] outbreak on Manhattan, The Division activated its First Wave of agents to carry out the mission and aid the [[Joint Task Force]], with the brunt of the wave sent to defend central Manhattan, where the virus was originally released and where the anarchy began.\n\n\n==== Infighting and Going Rogue ====\nThe Division's operations in central Manhattan failed, and the JTF was forced to evacuate and construct a wall around central Manhattan, creating the [[ N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]], and leaving many First Wave agents to fend for themselves. Angered by the heavy casualties the First Wave suffered in the Dark Zone, [[Aaron Keener]] decided to go [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue]], convinced many of his fellow surviving agents to do so as well, and killed off those still loyal to The Division. Keener made contact with [[Charles Bliss]] of the [[Last Man Battalion]] and aligned his agents with PMCs. The former making use of the latter's manpower and supplies, and the latter utilized the Division technology in exchange. In response to the inevitable arrival of the Second Wave, Keener arranged for the LMB to arm a surface-to-air missile to destroy the helicopter transporting Second Wave personnel.\n\n\n==== The Arrival of the Second Wave ====\nA Second Wave Division agent (the player's character) has been activated and was currently in [[Brooklyn]]. They made their way to the local safe house and made contact with fellow agent [[Faye Lau]]. After restoring order to Brooklyn and helping the JTF retake control of the police precinct, the agent joined Faye at the landing zone to meet [[Louis Chang|Commander Chang]]. However, much to their shock and horror, the VTOL is destroyed by the LMB's SAM, killing Chang and a part of the Second Wave personnel on board, and severely wounding Faye. A JTF helicopter comes to their aid and transports the two agents to [[Camp Hudson]].\n\nAfter landing, the agent makes their way to the JTF's [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]] in [[Pennsylvania Plaza]]. Finding the base under attack by [[Rioters]], the agent comes to the aid of the JTF garrison and repels them. After saving the base, the agent meets Faye again, but her injuries from The Division VTOL's destruction made her unfit to carry out the mission alongside the agent. Instead, Faye provides support to the agent by becoming the acting Division Commander.\n\n\n== Role in Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ==\nRoughly seven months after [[The Outbreak|Green Poison]] crippled New York, escalated cases of agents going [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue]] have occurred outside of the aforementioned city. Dissatisfied agents have different reasons for such, some followed [[Aaron Keener|Keener]]'s lead due to wanton discontent, some for loot and treasures in [[D.C. Dark Zones|Dark Zones]] and/or dangerous areas, and some who simply wish to return home, likely to protect their loved ones as well as live in peace. The SHD Network goes offline throughout the United States, causing select agents who vowed to continue The Division's goal to save what remains to head to Washington, D.C. in which they are billed as modern-day sheriffs by [[Manny Ortega]].\n\nBy the events of Warlords of New York and afterwards, the Division has also been severely crippled. Low morale, growing disillusionment with the government's failure to handle the outbreak aftermath, and other factors also caused further fractures and numerous other agents to turn rogue, and in some cases, join the hostile factions they're supposed to take down. Public support for them has diminished considerably due to the negative situational resurgence, causing many civilians to be wary of and sometimes discontent towards Division personnel.\n\nIt was this discontent that eventually led to the Division in D.C establishing an alliance with Keener and his team, as they have the means to sabotage Black Tusk from within, as direct conflict is bordering suicidal.\n== Relationships with other organizations ==\nPrior to the Dollar Flu outbreak, some hint of Directive 51's existence was leaked to the general public but it was never truly acknowledged. Those who knew of Directive 51 and The Division had found them deeply controversial, noting it's deep secrecy, the powers bestowed upon the organization, the relatively invasive qualities through the use of sleeper agents, and it's overall unconstitutional nature.\n\n=== JTF and the First Wave (New York) ===\nFollowing the activation of Division agents in response to the [[Green Poison|Dollar Flu]] outbreak, relations between The Division and joint [[CERA]] and [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] were mixed at best. [[Roy Benitez]], a JTF commander, like many officers in the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] and presumably a number of Army National Guardsmen, disliked the idea of federal involvement in the crisis. However, Benitez also urged his men not to alienate The Division and encouraged them to work alongside them, as while The Division are federal agents, they were also New Yorkers. On the other hand, some Division agents, like [[Javier Kajika]] and [[Alicia Coswald]], viewed the JTF with skepticism, recognizing that much of the JTF's personnel was comprised of policemen and National Guardsmen who were not trained to handle a crisis of the Dollar Flu's magnitude. \n\nAfter the JTF's disastrous failure to maintain control of Central Manhattan, which was walled off to quarantine the infected citizens, many First Wave agents were left to fend for themselves as the JTF was ordered to withdraw hastily. The action resulted in the deaths of many of the First Wave agents and numerous civilian casualties.\n\n=== The Second Wave (New York) ===\nWIP\n\n=== Rikers ===\nWIP\n\n=== Cleaners ===\nWIP\n\n=== Last Man Battalion ===\nWIP\n\n=== Hyenas ===\nWIP\n\n=== True Sons ===\nWIP\n\n=== Outcasts ===\nWIP\n\n=== Black Tusk ===\nWIP\n\n== Division Agents ==\nPlayers take the role of agents in the Strategic Homeland Division. Their main task is to save what's left of [[New York City]]. Because of the independent nature of these agents, and The Division being a self-supported tactical unit, they may attack other agents and go rogue or join up with other agents to accomplish their task.\n\n\n==== Division Commanders ====\nThese people lead the wave of agents. Each commander is responsible for their respective wave.\n\n\n==== Dark Zone Vendors ====\nThese non-combatant Division agents reside within the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]]'s safe-houses and checkpoints. Their merchandise can only be purchased with [[Currency|DZ Credits]].\n\n\n==== Rogue Agents (Last Man Battalion) ====\nDissatisfied and angered by the heavy casualties they sustained in trying to maintain control of the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]], as well as abandonment by the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]], many of the remaining agents of the First Wave went rogue. Led by [[Aaron Keener]] (who also convinced them to go rogue), they slaughtered other First Wave Division agents still loyal to The Division and formed an alliance with the [[Last Man Battalion]]. They are among the most dangerous enemies in the game.\n\n\n==== Rogue Agents (Player Characters) ====\nOther agents have gone rogue for various reasons. Some simply deserted, while others stole and killed people. There is also an example of an Division agent working with the [[Black Tusk]].\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nDefault 256 256.png|Division agent concept

This is shown as enemy factions battling with Division agents will refer to them as JTF or classify them as civilians trying to be brave, and deploying skills only catches them by surprise and confuses them.\n** The only two factions that seem to know the true abilities of the Division are the Joint Task Force (who have been working very closely with the Division) and the Last Man Battalion (who have Rogue First Wave agents on their side). But even for the latter, only the more elite LMB know about the Division, leaving the regular LMB unaware of the Division.\n*** JTF soldiers are often complimenting Division agents as they pass by them in Manhattan, often joking about getting gun like the agent's, saying that they'll be in their prayers, and thanking them for helping them out.\n** As of the introduction of the [[Underground]] and of [[Clear Sky]], the Rikers have started to catch on to the SHD presence in Manhattan, as Rikers obtained some new equipment from Division agents for the [[Secure Quarantine Center]] mission and intercepted a V-22 Osprey loaded with SHD Tech (which Slider referred to as \"Si-Fi Tech\").\n** As of 1.8: Resistance, with the deployment of Division agents to West Side Pier, only then the factions knew about how much of a threat the Division posed to them, leading the LMB to broker a truce between the factions against the Division.\n** Although confused, fearful and very scared, unarmed [[civilians]] recognize Division agents as good guys.\n* By the time of ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]'', the Division have fully established themselves, as this is shown that when engaging in most enemy factions usually taunt and threaten Division agents directly\n** Hyenas view the Division as authority figures in a non-authoritarian world, often directly threatening them and warning them to back off before \"they get themselves killed\" in their propaganda messages.\n** Outcasts view the Division as part of the reason they suffered in the Roosevelt Quarantine, threatening to attack them in their propaganda messages\n** True Sons sometimes use psychological warfare against the Division, attempting to spread the message that the Division should be feared because of ISAC (as the advantages of the highly advanced AI is known only to Division agents). They also try to convince Division agents to go rogue and join their side through their propaganda messages.\n** The Black Tusk are the most dangerous enemies the Division has come across, as they have covertly neutralized several agents in D.C. and caused the SHD Blackout that sent all Division agents in the D.C. area to the White House.\n** The JTF at the White House highly respect Division agents, as sentry guards often salute agents walking by and quickly apologizing should they bump into them at anytime.\n** The Civilian Militia (and the D.C. settlements in general) fully support the Division, as settlement members are heard complimenting agents as they walk by, and Militia soldiers often cheer agents on, even mentioning that children are pretending to be agents and that settlement members have formed Division fan clubs.\n** It is unknown if factions like the [[Underground (Faction)|Underground]] and the [[Ambushers]] know about the Division.\n** The Manhattan settlement [[Haven]] and their faction the [[Peacekeepers]] in [[Warlords of New York]] did not trust the Division at first, with their leader [[Paul Rhodes]] even going as far as turning away a Division agent he knew from the past and kept her from entering the settlement; this untrustworthy feeling only grew when [[Aaron Keener]] and his rogue agents showed up and started wrecking havoc on Lower Manhattan. However, the two factions eventually formed a mutual - albeit uneasy - alliance as the Division was slowly able to eliminate Keener and his lieutenants. In season [[Vanguard]], [[Aaron Keener|Keener]] and his lieutenant [[Theo Parnell|Parnell]] have made a return.\n* According to the book ''[[The World of Tom Clancy's The Division]], ''once activated, a Division agent outranks every government agent and official in the United States, excluding the President and entire federal agencies.\n* The Division is referenced alongside ''Splinter Cell'' in the fifth ''[https://farcry.fandom.com/wiki/Far_Cry_New_Dawn Far Cry New Dawn]'' expedition \"Government Plane Wreck\" wherein a war journal entry left in the crashed Paladin by Sam Fisher refers to him being put in contact with a Division team activated in Chicago following the nuclear attack on the United States in ''[https://farcry.fandom.com/wiki/Far_Cry_5 Far Cry 5]'''s \"Resist\" ending.\n*The Strategic Homeland Division (SHD) was established as a result of Presidential Directive 51, which ordered its creation as a decentralized response force for national emergencies. However, the SHD was formally organized under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), rather than being directly formed by the directive itself. The exact timeline of its formation remains unclear, but given that Calvin McManus served as Secretary of Homeland Security during its development, it is possible that he played a significant role in shaping its structure and operations.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division Resurgence]]''\n[[ru:\u0421\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0434]]\n[[Category:Factions]]\n[[Category:The Division]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:The Division Resurgence]]",

It serves as the capital city of the United States and is home to all three branches of the federal government. Before the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] it had a native population of seven hundred thousand, although commuters from the surrounding Virginia and Maryland suburbs would swell the D.C. population to well more than a million inhabitants during the workweek.\n\nSince the [[Green Poison]] pandemic swept through the federal district last year, the population has plummeted. After the initial outbreak, [[CERA]] set up refugee camps to house the large tourist population stranded in D.C. with nowhere to go. But smallpox and mob violence has slashed the number of residents and refugees by at least two-thirds. Many surviving civilians banded together to build small settlements that held together despite power outages, predatory raiders, and bouts of malnutrition.\n\n== History ==\n{{Quote|1=Ever since the JTF imploded, the city's become a playground for murderous fuckheads. There are several main factions and a whole lot of bottom feeders sucking up whatever the big dogs miss.|2=[[Manny Ortega]], on the state of Washington, D.C. after the collapse of the Washington JTF}}As the [[Green Poison]] outbreak wreaked havoc in [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]], officials in D.C. scrambled to find a viable solution to the chaos that was enveloping the nation. After much deliberation, [[President Waller]] signed the executive order known as [[Directive 51]] into law, activating agents of the [[Strategic Homeland Division]] and sending them into [[New York City|New York]]. Shortly afterward, Waller died of a heart attack.\n\nThe disease soon spread beyond Manhattan and found its way to the capital with devastating implications. Initially, those infected with the Green Poison were forcibly quarantined on [[Roosevelt Island]], but the quarantine was unsuccessful, allowing the disease to spread throughout the city. The disenfranchised survivors of the Roosevelt Island quarantine would become the faction known as the [[Outcasts]].\n\n[[CERA]], the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] and newly-appointed [[President Mendez]] attempted to maintain control of the city, but their attempts ended in disaster, leading to further chaos and unrest that was quickly grasping the city. Government officials tried to snuff out the virus by dousing infected areas with a experimental chemical known as [[DC-62]], but the chemical ended up being far more toxic than anticipated and left the areas uninhabitable, leading to the creation of the [[D.C. Dark Zones]]. To make matters worse, the D.C. JTF force, already incredibly weakened, began to further collapse as a large part of the organization defected and formed a rogue paramilitary faction known as the [[True Sons]], led by former JTF Officer [[Antwon Ridgeway]]. Finally, President Mendez died barely a week into his term, allegedly taking his own life.\n\nDeclaring the capital a loss, officials ordered a mass evacuation of all government and JTF personnel. Remaining members of the government and JTF evacuated via helicopter, leaving behind a skeleton crew of JTF operatives at the White House [[D.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]]. With the JTF no longer able to somewhat maintain order, the city descended into anarchy, with the Outcasts, the True Sons, and a scavenger faction known as the [[Hyenas]] establishing territory while looting, killing, and pillaging at random. The United States capital became a full-blown war zone, with innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. These civilians would eventually band together as a ragtag militia, forming settlements and supply chains across the ruins of the city and fighting to regain territory from the rival factions.\n\nSometime after the evacuation, while transporting newly-appointed [[President Ellis]], Air Force One was shot down over D.C. by unknown forces, causing it to crash in front of the [[Capitol Building]]. No trace of the President was found at the crash site, and he has been missing ever since.\n\n== Events of Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ==\nSix months after the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]], the [[SHD Network]] experiences a global blackout, and [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents receive a distress call from Washington, D.C. Upon arrival, the city is in ruins, with various factions fighting over territory and the streets littered with garbage and debris. Division Coordinator [[Manny Ortega]] is in charge of SHD operations in the D.C. area, and tasks agents with various missions to help restore the SHD Network and reclaim the city from the warring factions.\n\nWith the help of [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] personnel, the [[Civilian Militia]], and the still-alive [[President Ellis]], The Division wages a campaign against the factions, culminating in a full assault on the [[True Sons]] occupied [[Capitol Building]]. With all the faction leaders eliminated, the SHD Network restored, and the territory reclaimed, the survivors of D.C. celebrate. However, the city is soon thrown into chaos again when a new faction known as [[Black Tusk]] invades D.C., turning the city into a full-blown war zone. The heavily-armed PMC group has been tasked with eliminating The Division and taking back the capital, as well as securing a series of broad-spectrum antivirals for use against future outbreaks. The Division eventually mounts an assault against their stronghold, stealing the antivirals and disabling their transportation. A Black Tusk operative named [[Milla \"Wyvern\" Radek|Wyvern]] goes rogue and attempts to blow up[[D.C. Base of Operations| The White House]], but is neutralized by Division agents.\n\n== Zones ==\n{{Main|Locations/Tom_Clancy%27s_The_Division_2}}\n\nThe playable area consists of 13 PvE zones and 3 PvP [[D.C.

In ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]'', they are the group most focused on halting and containing the spread of the [[Green Poison]] virus.\n\n== Pre-game Lore ==\nCERA was created to help deal with large-scale natural disasters, when the situation was overwhelming local and state relief efforts. It can be assumed that CERA was also in New York when Hurricane Sandy hit (since the former has been mentioned in the game several times over).\n\n== Tom Clancy's The Division  ==\n\n=== Initial Outbreak ===\nDuring the first few weeks of the outbreak, CERA was not sent into Manhattan, as it was initially thought that the disease spreading was a more potent version of the flu.\n\nShortly after however, they were bought in New York when hospitals and clinics became overwhelmed with patients and state relief efforts were under the risk of failing.\n\n=== During the First Wave ===\nWhen the First Wave of [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents was deployed, CERA was in charge of all field hospitals, treatment centers, [[Safe Houses]], supervised the construction of the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]], and was the organization that dug up the mass graves to bury the bodies. They also employed volunteers to help them ration out food and supplies to civilians in need. Vehicles (from cars to transport CERA officials to shipping eight-wheeler trucks) can be found all over the New York City and were used to adequately deliver much-needed supplies.\n\nHowever, food, medical, and personnel shortages led to increased riots, to the point where the [[Joint Task Force]] (who were in charge of protecting these supplies and personnel) couldn't handle it. After the major disaster of the Dark Zone, along with the First Wave Division agents going M.I.A., forced CERA to pull out alongside the JTF, and CERA support from all hospitals and treatment centers ended.\n\n=== Currently ===\nCERA has been incredibly weakened at this point, with very little manpower. However, despite this lack of manpower, CERA still continues to treat the sick and research for a cure alongside local doctors and nurses, although this research and treatment is limited to those who stay in the [[ N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]] and some Safe Houses.\n\n==== New York Collapse ====\nIn [[Tom Clancy's The Division: New York Collapse|New York Collapse]] (an Interactive novel based on the Survival Guide in game) there is a yellow sign from CERA stating that they'll be in the neighborhood vaccinating everyone against smallpox. This is before CERA lost their grip on supply delivery, and before they discovered that the smallpox strain was heavily mutated, rendering the vaccine useless.\n\n== Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ==\nActive CERA operations in D.C. most likely ended with the evacuation of the [[JTF]] from D.C., or followed shortly afterward. CERA checkpoints, camps, evacuation points and treatment facilities are scattered throughout the city, yet none of these facilities are active due to the complete collapse of security, supplies and communications. CERA, in joint operations with the JTF, also attempted to create quarantines and mass treatment facilities like the [[Roosevelt Island|Roosevelt Island Quarantine]] and the [[Potomac Event Center |Potomac Event Center Treatment Facility]] that were put under control of [[Antwon Ridgeway|Colonel Ridgeway]] and his men, who notoriously abused and starved the sick, believing that they were as good as dead and not worth the resources; Ridgeway and his unit's actions would eventually lead to the rise of the [[Outcasts]]. CERA's role in the Washington, D.C. narrative is essentially nonexistent at this point in the game, with the faction's personnel and capabilities having evaporated with the JTF pullout. However, the doctors who work in the health clinics at the various settlements as well as at the Base of Operations are most likely related to or are associated with CERA. It is also implied that CERA is responsible for supplying the JTF in the White House.\n\nIn Warlords of New York, CERA's presence in the city has also been dismal, with no active operations being visible to the player. CERA crates, barricades, outposts and trucks can be found throughout the city, like the JTF shelter in [[Two Bridges]] and on [[Liberty Island]] (used as an evacuation point). It is also inferred that CERA is supplying JTF, Division and civilian installations around the country when acting Division Commander [[Faye Lau]] and Captain [[Roy Benitez]] talk about CERA shipments and troop counts. Instead of operating as an actual faction, CERA has now taken the role of supplying the JTF and Division with food, water and medicine.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n=== Tom Clancy's The Division ===\nUnlike the JTF, CERA has no role, gameplay-wise. They are mostly a background faction, usually requesting agents to collect data during [[Encounters]], and play a bigger role than usual during the mission [[Hudson Refugee Camp]], where both CERA and JTF doctors and soldiers who are first aid-certified arrive on the scene to take blood samples from the survivors.\n\nCERA workers can be found in the Base of Operations (usually in the Medical Wing) treating sick or wounded JTF soldiers and/or civilians, and can be found in a few safe houses.\n\n=== Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ===\nBy this time, CERA is a shadow faction - it is known that they were in D.C., but there are no indicators that they are still operating fully in the city. It is widely assumed that medics and workers have either merged in with the JTF and work in the Sick Bay, left when the bulk force of the JTF pulled out of the city, or were violently murdered by the hostile factions in the city.\n\n== Real Life Counterpart ==\nThe real-life counterpart of CERA is FEMA ('''F'''ederal '''E'''mergency '''M'''anagement '''A'''gency), as both are federal agencies that are dispatched when local and state relief efforts have failed or been overwhelmed from natural disasters. Their logos are also similar when compared.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"310\">\nFEMA-logo-2.jpg|The seal/logo for the Federal Emergency.

And with the losses that True Sons suffered by [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]], Wally was cut loose alongside non-essential personnel.\n\nAfter the events at [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center]], Wally would come out of the shadows to help [[Captain Lewis|Fred Lewis]] and [[Manny Ortega]] in working on the intel towards stopping the alliance between the True Sons and [[Black Tusk]]. Despite working for [[General Anderson]] for a while, both Wally and Lewis felt that allying with Black Tusk only meant power for Anderson and that he didn't truly care for the True Sons. Despite not being able to assassinate General Anderson, Division agents managed to rescue Lewis in the [[Pentco Fairview Power Plant]] and extract before Black Tusk's fleet of hovercrafts arrived.\n\nNot long after the events at the power plant, Wally settled in the [[Castle Settlement]], though it would take her time to adjust and being able to trust people. She attended a session with Doctor [[Mitchell Billings]], where she talked about her time in the True Sons, her friendship with Lewis, using humor to cope with trauma, and the reason for her defection.\n\nWhen Division agents made their move against [[Zachary \"Stovepipe\" Beattie|Stovepipe]] and his fellow Lieutenants, Wally acted as the coordinator for the agents, where she decrypted the data from the [[Hunters|Hunter]] drones they intercepted. She also coordinated the agents to [[Coney Island Ballpark (Manhunt: Stovepipe)|Coney Island]] to intercept Stovepipe. However, it would turn out that Stovepipe was killed by [[Natalya Sokolova]] for his disloyalty before they arrived and had ambushed Division agents using a plethora of Black Tusk UAVs, mini tanks, [[Warhound|Warhounds]], 2 [[XB-31 \"Marauder\"|Marauder]] quadcopters, and even [[Sparkle]]; a prototype flamethrower Warhound. Despite all that, the agents managed to prevail, though they wouldn't celebrate as Wally reveals to them that Stovepipe and the ambush was a diversion while Sokolova sent Black Tusk forces to breach the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]] and eliminate a comatose [[Bardon Schaeffer]]. Not wasting time, Division agents went back to [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] to secure the stronghold.\n\nAfter the attack of the White House by Black Tusk, Wally and Manny discussed the number of people who were kidnapped by the Black Tusk while coping with the losses they suffered. Once again, Wally acted as mission control for Division agents to rescue [[John Yazzie]], [[Eva Garcia]], [[Lauren Fong]], [[Mitchell Billings]], and [[Mari Singh]]. In addition, when the doors to the underground [[National Security Agency|NSA]] facility that housed the [[Descent|combat simulation program]] were open, Wally does her part in helping Division agents decrypting the intel they scour through the simulation from the NSA databases.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:NPC]]\n[[Category:People]]",

Lewis is the Prime-Target featured in Season 9, [[Hidden Alliance]].\n\n== Biography ==\nFredrick Lewis grew up on the ocean. He spent his summers on his pappy's fishing boat rescuing tourists who had gotten themselves in trouble off the coast of North Carolina. Those summers shaped the man he would become. Lewis saw himself as a savior. The one person who could defeat the sea and to bring a lost soul home. He joined the Coast Guard fresh out of high school and worked his way up to the prestigious Search and Rescue team. \n\nHis wife wanted him to move to Kentucky to build a homestead. The property value on their old fishing shack ballooned to the point that they could trade their shack on the beach for forty acres and a cow. Fred gave in to his wife's reasonable dreams and they moved to Kentucky.\n\nA year later, he was bored of pretending to be a farmer and joined the Kentucky National Guard. Two years later, his wife had an affair with the young man they hired to help around the farm. When Lewis found out, he got eerily quiet, packed a bag, got in his truck with his dog, Ransom; and drove back to North Carolina and moved in with his pappy. He rejoined the Coast Guard, tried to rebuild his life, then the [[Green Poison]] was released, and he was called to support the [[Joint Task Force]] effort in [[Washington, D.C.]] He had a lot of anger, pain, and resentment from his failed marriage and instead of dealing with that pain and trauma he decided to pass it on to other people he was tasked to lead and care for.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the death of former [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] commander [[Faye Lau]] at [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: Faye Lau)|Camp White Oak]], Captain Lewis was ordered by [[General Anderson]] to send his specialized team to [[Washington, D.C.]], with a yet-to-be known objective. \n\nAfter advancing on D.C. with his armored convoy and encountering unusual drone activity near roadblocks, Captain Lewis eventually entered [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center]] as per General Anderson's orders. There, Lewis and his team were ambushed by and faced with heavy [[Black Tusk]] resistance, eventually, all of his men were gone at the hands of the B.T.S.U., the Captain being the only one left to defend himself. After clearing out some of the Black Tusk forces near the entrance, Lewis contacted the arriving Division agents (who were there to apprehend him) requesting their help to fight the Black Tusk. Although initially distrusting, the agents, per [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]]'s request, agreed to help him, as long he helped them too by defending the SHD Node from any possible threats. Before leaving for the Node, Lewis warns the agents that the B.T.S.U. were not the biggest threat present on-site, and tells them to watch out for the \"recruiter\" (A.K.A the [[Hunters|Hunter]] that was present on-site to watch over [[Jack Bonney]] and test him for recruitment process into the Hunters). \n\nAfter doing so, Lewis escaped through unknown means, however, as a man of his word, Lewis would still aid The Division even after leaving, just as he agreed to. As the agents arrive at the final portion of Jefferson Trade Center and prepare to face off against B.T.S.U. Operative and Hunter in-training Jack Bonney, Lewis provides air support by air raiding the battlefield with [[DC-62]] airstrikes, much to Kelso's disliking. The agents eventually take down Bonney and his Black Tusk forces, soon realizing he had an [[Smart Watch|Agent Watch]] with him, with [[ISAC]] detecting Bonney had Agent Status, much to their confusion. Kelso tries to ask Lewis what the meaning of this was, but the Captain wasn't quite sure either, only telling her that if she was ever to find out what was truly going on there, she should find him and request his support again. \n\nAfter the incident at Jefferson Trade Center, General Anderson began attempting to make an alliance with the Black Tusk once again, which left Lewis questioning his loyalty to the True Sons' cause. It was around this time that Lewis started to recruit more of his fellow True Sons to his side in secret, creating a rogue branch that would go against the Black Tusk and [[Natalya Sokolova]]. Lewis would eventually contact [[Manny Ortega]] of the JTF, who had once been his colleague and close friend before [[Antwon Ridgeway|Ridgeway]]'s defection.  \n\nThough initially rough at first, the duo's interactions eventually became calmer, as they began to plot a way for Frederick's rogue True Sons to switch over to the Division's side, though Manny was still worried that Anderson might find out. The General eventually did find out their plot, as Sokolova was able to intercept and record their conversation. Anderson would imprison Lewis and his fellow rogues, executing some of them in the process. Imprisoned at the [[Pentco Fairview Power Plant (Manhunt: General Anderson)|Pentco Fairview Power Plant]], same place where Anderson and Sokolova would meet up in person, Lewis was eventually rescued again by the very same Division agents. He would then attempt to go after Anderson to take him as a prisoner, but to no avail.  \n\nIn the extraction chopper, the Captain would brief Agent Kelso on Sokolova. \n\nAfter failing to recruit [[Zachary \"Stovepipe\" Beattie|Zachary Beattie]] and during the attack on White House, Lewis had managed to buy Manny some time to escort [[Bardon Schaeffer]] into the panic room, while repelling the Black Tusk wave, but he was later killed by a Hunter who was under Sokolova's order. \n\n\n== Legacy ==\nRansom was given with Lewis' dog tag as a token to remember by [[Manny Ortega|Manny]] himself.\n\n\n== Abilities ==\nIn-game, Captain Frederick Lewis is a ''friendly'' True Sons Assault armed with a [[POF P416/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Custom P416 G3]] assault rifle. \n\nHe can also be seen wielding a [[M4/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Police M4]] by the end of [[Pentco Fairview Power Plant (Manhunt: General Anderson)|Season 10's final mission]], during the extraction phase.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:S9TP - CAPT LEWIS.png\nFile:Cpt Lewis.png\n</gallery>\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Captain Lewis is the first ever Manhunt Target to not engage the player in combat during the final mission ([[Aaron Keener]], [[Molly \"Jupiter\" Henderson|Jupiter]], [[Carter \"Hornet\" Leroux|Hornet]], [[Bardon Schaeffer|Schaeffer]] and [[Faye Lau]] all face the player as boss fights by the end of their Manhunt Missions, while Lewis becomes an ally right at the start of his mission).\n*Despite not using it in-game, in both his character artwork and the in-game briefing video, Lewis is depicted as using the Military variant of the P416 instead of the Custom variant.\n**Additionally, in the CGI trailer for Season 10, Lewis is instead shown using a [[AK-47/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Black Market AK-M]].\n* His dog, Ransom will behave similar to the puppy that resided in New York Safe Haven, allowing players/agent to interact with, during the launch of Season 11 and rebuild Castle Settlement.\n\n\n== Missions ==\n* [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center Manhunt: Captain Lewis]]\n* [[Pentco Fairview Power Plant (Manhunt: General Anderson)|Pentco Fairview Power Plant: General Anderson]]\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n* [[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]\n\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Enemies]]\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:True Sons]]\n[[Category:Manhunt Targets]]",

Unlike other True Sons RPG units, Ridgeway's Carl Gustav M3 cannot be disabled by destroying his ammo pouches.\n\n====Operation Iron Horse====\nDuring Operation Iron Horse, the Carl Gustav M3 is a special weapon dropped by True Sons RPG units when killed, and can be picked up and used by the player. Only one can be carried per player, and is dropped upon switching weapons and discarded after use. There is a limit to how many are available at once, and further True Sons RPG units will not spawn until one has been used. \n\nWhile devastating against enemy infantry, their primary use is to damage various mission-critical targets, such as pressure tanks, armored turrets, and the artillery shells for the Iron Horse's Earthshaker cannon.\n\nThe final boss of the raid, [[Morozova|Colonel Morozova]], uses a custom Carl Gustav M3 named '''Reckoning''', which fires airborne barrages.

Snow opened the doors of the Castle to anyone affected by the crisis, which led to the spread of [[Green Poison]] from within the walls. Due to repeated attacks from the True Sons, the Castle eventually collapsed.\n\nAfter the initial [[The Outbreak|smallpox outbreak]] in December, [[CERA]] established one of its very first refugee camps in the Smithsonian Castle on the National Mall. This camp housed out-of-towners stranded in southern [[Washington, D.C.]] after the early evacuations. Over time, the Castle transformed into the first so-called \"settlement\" with communal resources, medical services, and an organized defense aided by the building's formidable structure. Despite heavy rioting and looting just to the north along Pennsylvania Avenue, the Castle remained a safe haven for refugees and local citizens looking to escape the mayhem of the streets.\n\nBut as winter turned to spring, the intensity of attacks grew as a powerful new faction, the True Sons, expanded westward down the Mall from their base in the United States [[Capitol Building]]. By April the Castle was essentially surrounded by True Sons territory and the [[Tidal Basin]] flooding to the south and cut off from the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] Base of Operations in [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]] to the north.\n\nIn early June, a True Sons assault finally managed to breach the Castle walls. After two days of fierce, desperate, and often heroic fighting, the settlers were wiped out and the settlement was contaminated with DC-62 missiles. By then, The True Sons took control the entire south-eastern part of the city.\n\nBy ''[[Puppeteers (Year 5 Season 2)|Year 5 Season 2: Puppeteers]]'', however, the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] successfully rebuilt the Castle as a functioning settlement while pursuing [[Brian Johnson|The Recruiter]].\n\n== The Assault ==\nThe Castle Settlement was regularly assaulted and tormented by the [[True Sons]], who demanded more tribute from the Castle Settlement as payment for being in operation. \n\nSergeant [[Mike Snow]] even tried to broker a mutually beneficial truce with the True Sons, promising to not be any threat to the True Sons in exchange for being left alone by the True Sons, which the True Sons noted that [[Antwon Ridgeway|General Ridgeway]] would not adhere to. \n\nThe True Sons kept launching various assaults on the Castle Settlement, but these assaults were always a failure due to the civilian's perseverance. Finally engaged and annoyed by their lack of progress, [[Wilson|Captain Wilson]], a True Son in-charge of administrating the affairs of the True Sons in [[Jefferson Plaza]] proposed to utilize their newly developed chemical weapons, which were made from harvesting [[DC-62]] from within the Jefferson Plaza, against the Castle Settlement. \n\nBy the time [[Alani Kelso|Agent Kelso]] arrived at the Castle Settlement, the True Sons of the Jefferson Plaza had already fired a mortar made from the DC-62 onto the Castle Settlement, decimating all of their progress, materials and most of their members, with only seven confirmed survivors. An enraged Kelso demanded that the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agent should assault the True Sons inside Jefferson Plaza and kill every last one of them as an act of vengeance for the destruction they have caused to the Castle Settlement.\n\nIndeed, the agent would go to Jefferson Plaza to shut down the DC-62 stored there and kill Captain Wilson and his unit for their role in the destruction of the settlement.\n\n\n== Reconstruction of the Castle ==\nIn the months since the death of [[True Sons|Captain Wilson]] and destruction of his [[DC-62]] facility, de-contamination efforts were made to make the settlement habitable again. After it became habitable, a number of civilians and [[True Sons]] defectors joined to help reconstruct the Castle. This included people like [[Mari Singh]], [[Candice Wallace]], [[John Yazzie]], [[Eva Garcia]], and more. Each of them having their role and doing their part in making the settlement sustainable and able to thrive. \n\nHowever, reconstruction efforts were on hold when [[Black Tusk]] kidnapped several civilians during their attack on the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]].\n\nAs [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents rescued the civilians from their captivity, the Castle grew further, building up defenses, infrastructure, and communications. And with [[Vikram Malik]] and his sister [[Birdie Malik|Birdie]] rescued as well, this ensured to keep the settlement's power grid stable.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nWIP\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Settlements]]",

Originally developed to combat the [[Green Poison]], the substance was later discovered to become toxic under certain conditions, and is the primary reason for the existence of the [[D.C. Dark Zones|Dark Zones]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Its basic form is a fine, yellow powder.\n\nStockpiles of DC-62 were later weaponized by the [[True Sons]], who used it to wipe out the [[Castle Settlement]] and threaten the [[Campus Settlement]] before they were stopped by the [[Strategic Homeland Division]].\n\n== Overview ==\nDC-62 achieves its purpose of eliminating traces of Green Poison, but becomes highly toxic when exposed to cold temperatures. Merely breathing airborne particles can cause respiratory issues, followed by death soon afterwards. Any items that come into contact with the substance must subsequently be destroyed or thoroughly decontaminated.\n\nIts most common appearance is that of a yellow powder, typically stored in yellow barrels; it can also be condensed into liquid form. DC-62 loses potency over time and exposure to weather, but can still overwhelm mask filters in concentrated doses.\n\n==History ==\nAlthough Dr. [[Kavita Chandrasekhar]]'s laboratory in Michigan had managed to synthesize a [[Broad-Spectrum Antiviral|broad-spectrum antiviral]] (BSAV) capable of curing the Green Poison, analysts estimated that it would be twelve months before enough samples could be produced to inoculate the general public. \n\nWith D.C. reeling from mass infections, the federal government desperately needed a more immediate stopgap solution. The result was DC-62, a chemical disinfectant proven to destroy traces of Green Poison; despite presidential staff requesting additional field testing, they were pressured by [[Joint Task Force]] leadership into granting approval for mass production and rapid deployment.\n\nDue to the influence of Professor [[Victor Tranh]], the upscale neighborhood of Georgetown was selected as the first testbed for DC-62. Its wealthy residents had erected walls to keep out the infected population, and the entire district was fumigated in the yellow powder. It was only after locals began dying from respiratory complications that JTF officials discovered the substance became toxic when exposed to cold temperatures. Georgetown was evacuated and sealed off, and later became known as [[Dark Zone West]].\n\nThe vast quantities of existing DC-62 were moved into storage in the military staging grounds at Capitol Station. Some time later, an explosion at the stockpile facility blanketed the entire area in yellow powder, forcing a swift evacuation of all personnel and abandonment of vast amounts of supplies and military hardware. Like Georgetown, the area was walled off and renamed [[Dark Zone East]].\n\nThe remaining supply of DC-62 was relocated to a new staging ground near the Waterfront. However, in early April, heavy rains caused the Potomac River to overflow its banks and flood a vast area of southern D.C., including the DC-62 storage depots and the [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel]] settlement. The waters became contaminated with the substance, forcing another evacuation from what would become [[Dark Zone South]].\n\nFollowing Col. [[Antwon Ridgeway]]'s insurrection, the True Sons seized control of [[Jefferson Plaza]] and, with it, vast stockpiles of DC-62. A unit led by Cpt. [[Wilson]] devised a method to weaponize the substance into mortar shells, and began using the D.C. Metro tunnels to transport the munitions around the city, including beneath the [[Lincoln Memorial]].\n\n=== ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2''===\nIn late May, The True Sons began pressuring civilians at the Castle Settlement to align with them, providing tribute in the form of food and supplies in exchange for protection. When their leader [[Mike Snow]] refused, they began a weeks-long siege on the settlement; ultimately, Ridgeway ordered his men at Jefferson Plaza to bombard the Castle with DC-62 rounds, killing all but seven inhabitants.\n\nAgent [[Alani Kelso]] witnessed the attack and dispatched Division agents to Jefferson Plaza immediately. The agents eliminated Wilson and the rest of the True Sons responsible, and [[Manny Ortega]] sent in a team to dispose of the remaining DC-62. The Division also uncovered the True Sons' remaining stockpile of chemical munitions at the Lincoln Memorial and prevented them from being used against the Campus Settlement to the north.\n\nDuring [[Black Tusk]]'s invasion of D.C. after Ridgeway's death, a team led by [[Kathy \"Poppy\" Huang]] secured fresh barrels of DC-62 at Jefferson Plaza, hoping to reverse-engineer and mass produce it in liquid form. The Division managed to neutralize Huang and her team before they could transport the supply off-site.\n\n====Hidden Alliance====\nInside the [[Jefferson Trade Center]], Division agents met with True Sons breakaway [[Captain Lewis]], who was being attacked by [[Black Tusk]] forces led by [[Jack Bonney]] as part of an initiation test to join the [[Hunters]]. During their final encounter with Bonney, Lewis attempted to help The Division by bombarding the Black Tusk with DC-62 mortars; in response, Bonney called in a [[XB-31 \"Marauder\"|Marauder]] quadcopter to reinforce his troops. After Bonney's death, Kelso ordered Lewis to stop using the yellow powder if he wished to ally with the Division.\n\n=== Reign of Fire ===\nWhen Division agents was sent to deal with [[Zachary \"Stovepipe\" Beattie|Stovepipe]] due to the supposed threat of dirty bombs against New York, one of the recordings that was decrypted from a [[Hunters|Hunter]] drone had [[Lieutenant Bantam]] making a supply request to [[General Anderson]] DC-62 to retrofit more mortars, which the General denied as he believed that contamination threats\n\n==Trivia==\n*DC-62 is similar in appearance to Compound Z8, a biological weapon used by the Operator [https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Smoke_(Siege) Smoke] in ''[https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six_Siege Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege]''.\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Broken Dawn]]''\n[[Category:Gameplay]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Equipment]]\n[[Category:Content]]\n[[Category:Lore]]",

Anderson is the Prime Target in the ''[[Price of Power]]'' season.\n\n== History ==\nGeneral Peter Anderson was never an extraordinary man, but he always considered himself an exceptional man. Proximity to power and control was the way he sought value. He is very status driven. Serving his country in the Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard was a way to show that he was not just a paper pusher but was still a \"real soldier\".\n\nTeased relentless as a child for being fixated on order and efficiency, he surrounded himself with charismatic popular people to learn how they managed to gain that social currency. He realized charismatic people are very rarely interested in process and saw an opportunity to build himself a sheltered and protected position as the man who knew where all the bodies were buried and how the system worked, allowing the leaders to be charismatic while he held the real power behind the scenes.\n\nNow that [[Antwon Ridgeway|Ridgeway]] is gone and the [[True Sons]] are looking for direction, Anderson can put his years of studying the narcissistic mind to his advantage. Ridgeway's vision was small, Anderson will take the True Sons national. He will set up a network across the country and use Ridgeway's death to reframe him as a martyr and vilify the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]].\n\nAt some point after the [[Green Poison]] outbreak, Anderson became one of Antwon Ridgeway's True Sons, eventually ranking up to be one of his top strategists and advisors. After Ridgeway's death at the hands of the Division, Anderson became the new de-facto leader of the True Sons.\n\n=== Ending a partnership ===\nDuring the events of ''[[Concealed Agenda]]'', Anderson was in direct contact with [[Natalya Sokolova]], founder and CEO of the [[Black Tusk]], forming an alliance with them due to their shared operative, [[Linette \"Dusk\" Edwards]]. After Dusk's death, Anderson was contacted by a furious [[Sergeant Daniels]], who wished to avenge her former ally and friend, however, the now General Anderson would instead instruct her to act with caution, as they both agreed that the B.T.S.U. had way too many [[Rogue Division Agents]] in their ranks and would be a liability.\n\nShortly after, he would be contacted by B.T.S.U. Leader [[Bardon Schaeffer]] to send his condolences for Dusk's death, however, the General informed him he would no longer need his services as a \"glorified errand boy\", ending the negotiations with him and the Black Tusk. Later, upon being told by [[Major Xander]] that [[Faye Lau]] tried to contact her via her former relationship with [[Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas]], Anderson called Sokolova to question her trying to persuade his men to join her side, instead, the General discovered she was unaware of this, once again stating the end of their alliance and telling her to stay away from his troops.\n\n=== A new operation ===\nAfter the events at [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: Faye Lau)|Camp White Oak]], Anderson would begin a mysterious operation in D.C., seemingly to investigate the connection between the [[Hunters]] and the Black Tusk, leaving [[Captain Lewis]] in charge of the operation. Later, Lewis's men would be swarmed and killed by B.T.S.U. troops led by [[Jack Bonney]] and [[Brian Johnson|The Recruiter]] at [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center]], where the Captain would later be saved by Division agents.\n\n=== Re-establishing an alliance ===\nSometime after, General Anderson realizes his True Sons don't have enough supplies and manpower to sustain a long-term conflict against The Division or the B.T.S.U., so he contacts Sokolova once again to rebuild their former alliance, with the PMC's CEO sending an advance team comprised of [[Mathias \"Trig\" Schneider]], [[Shawn \"Micro\" Clarke]], [[Sandra \"Chirpy\" Patterson]] and [[Mitchell \"Lucky\" Woods]] to aid the True Sons General in his operation.\n\nDuring the operation, Anderson would notice Captain Lewis's discomfort working alongside \"Trig\", which would slowly lead him to question the Captain's loyalty to their cause. Eventually, Sokolova would share a recording of Lewis speaking to [[Manny Ortega]], as the two plotted against the True Sons and Black Tusk. Anderson would then order \"Lucky\" to end the B.T.S.U.'s support to the [[Hyenas]] and \"Chirpy\" to imprison Lewis and his fellow traitors.\n\nAfter all, four of his Black Tusk lieutenants were taken down, Anderson prepared for his meeting with Natalya at the [[Pentco Fairview Power Plant (Manhunt: General Anderson)|Pentco Fairview Power Plant]], where he had also imprisoned the rogue Captain. Eventually, Division agents would arrive on-site to rescue Lewis and attempt to kill Anderson. Anderson would be escorted to the docks by his bodyguard [[Hank \"Bough\" Bibichev]], where he would board a Black Tusk hovercraft and escape the agents, who were successful in rescuing his former subordinate.\n\n=== Failure at Roosevelt Island ===\nGeneral Anderson wouldn't be heard again until much later while the Division went to Roosevelt Island to recover Faye Lau's Mobile SHD Server, where he and Natalya Sokolova were overseeing True Sons forces who were sent to the island to recover the server. Despite efforts to stop the agents, the operation went completely sideways when Lieutenant Ducky Gadwall focused on avenging his brother's death. \n\nAnd with the agents decimating the True Sons personnel, Sokolova called off the operation, expressing her disappointment at Anderson, who could only apologize for his troops failure in their mission.\n\n\n\n== Abilities ==\nDespite never directly engaging the agents in-game, General Anderson is depicted as a Black Tusk Assault armed with a [[SCAR-L/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Tactical Mk16]] Assault Rifle.\n\nDuring his final mission, Anderson escapes while leaving his Black Tusk bodyguard, [[Hank \"Bough\" Bibichev]], to fight the player instead.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Division 2 Season 10 wallpaper 1.png|General Anderson with his lieutenants.\nFile:TCTD2 MainPoster S10 960x540.jpg\nFile:General Anderson and Sokolova.jpg|General Anderson with Natalya Sokolova during Season 11 Trailer\n</gallery>\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite the [[Pentco Fairview Power Plant (Manhunt: General Anderson)]] mission log showing \"Peter Anderson\" as it's only boss fight, Anderson himself is never encountered in the mission, while [[Nico \"Brain\" McPherson]] and [[Hank \"Bough\" Bibichev]] are the actual boss fights during the mission itself.\n**This is made even more curious considering promotional materials and trailers for the season depict him as being armed with an assault rifle (Military P416 in the artworks and Tactical Mk16 in the briefing cutscene), further implying that he would eventually be a boss fight during the mission. It is unknown if this was purposefully done to trick the player into thinking Anderson would be fought, or if he was indeed meant to be faced at some point during development.\n*General Anderson is the second Manhunt prime target to never engage the player in combat. The first being Captain Lewis. All previous Prime Targets engaged the agent as boss fights by the end of their missions ([[Aaron Keener]], [[Molly \"Jupiter\" Henderson|Jupiter]], [[Carter \"Hornet\" Leroux|Hornet]], [[Bardon Schaeffer]], and [[Faye Lau]]).\n**While Lewis never becomes a boss due to allying himself with the player, Anderson is instead never actually physically encountered during his entire mission, choosing to escape from the agents instead of taking the risk of facing them.\n**This also marks Anderson as the first prime target to not ever physically encounter the agent at all.\n*As confirmed by game director Yannick Banchereau, Anderson's jacket is the same one that belonged to General Ridgeway prior to his death.\n*In the Chinese version of the game, which is known to be vastly different compared to the main version, Anderson is actually killed-in-action at the end of his manhunt, with his boss fight taking place at the [[Rayburn House]] in southwest as a Bounty (as in said version, the Countdown game mode does not exist). \n**In this version's final boss fight, Anderson is a unique Black Tusk Assault armed with a [[M4/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Police M4]] and [[Support Station|BTSU Support Stations]].\n== Missions ==\n* [[Pentco Fairview Power Plant (Manhunt: General Anderson)|Pentco Fairview Power Plant: General Anderson]] (voice/cutscene only)\n* [[Stranded Tanker (Manhunt: Alani Kelso)|Stranded Tanker: Alani Kelso]] (mentioned only)\n* [[Roosevelt Island: Alani Kelso]] (voice only)\n== Appearances ==\n* [[Tom Clancy's The Division 2|''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'']]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:Enemies]]\n[[Category:True Sons]]\n[[Category:Manhunt Targets]]\n[[Category:Black Tusk]]",
  "Green Poison": "{{Template:Virus\n|image     = Green Poison Banknote.jpg\n|specialty = Infectious Disease\n|variant   = [[Wikipedia:Chimera (virus)|Variola Chimera]]<br/>[[Wikipedia:Smallpox|Variola Major]]\n|symptoms  = Fever<br/>Vomiting\n|causes    = Spread between People}}'''Smallpox Variola Chimera'''\u00a0(commonly known as the '''''Dollar''''' '''''Flu'' '''or\u00a0'''''Green Poison''''') is a genetically engineered super-virus based on the disease\u00a0[[Wikipedia:Smallpox|Smallpox]], created with no functional vaccine or cure. This genetically augmented\u00a0virus was manufactured by [[Gordon Amherst|Dr. Gordon Amherst]], a delusional, genocidal environmentalist and gifted virologist as a means of population control. 95% of the population is susceptible to the virus, but 5% are genetically immune. The disease was unleashed in [[New York City]] during a [[Wikipedia:Black_Friday_(shopping)|Black Friday]] by contaminated U.S. dollar bills with the virus being spread in several retail stores across [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]], most notably\u00a0in [[Broadway Emporium|Abel's Department Store]].\u00a0\n\n== Description of the Green Poison Virus ==\nThe DNA of ''Variola Chimera'' was digitized to be infinitely mutable; intelligence findings indicate that [[Gordon Amherst|Dr. Gordon Amherst]] synthesized hundreds of variations seeking to create a strain with a 90 percent mortality rate. The virus itself can remain dormant for months in wounds on corpses or on various organic and synthetic surfaces, so contagion in an infected area can remain long after hosts have expired or been relocated. \n\nThe virus spreads in a method similar to the flu, entering the host body through the mouth, nose, ears, or eyes by droplets in the air or through manual contact with contaminated surfaces. It has a very high lethality rate and survivors are often left horribly scarred, and sometimes blind. The naturally occurring variant killed about 30 percent of those infected, although among children the rate was closer to 80 percent. The chimera variant is rumored to kill 90 percent of its victims across the board. Even if one survives the effects of the virus, many patients still fall victim to the failing infrastructure as society continues to collapse under the immense pressure of the pandemic. \n\nVariola chimera has a seven-day incubation period during which the virus grows in the host's body, but no symptoms are visible. During this period, the infected person will usually look and feel normal and healthy, and cannot infect others (this compares to Variola Major's eleven-day incubation; if a victim receives the vaccine during Major's first three days, the disease will not fully develop). Once smallpox incubation ends, the host develops flu-like symptoms - fever, headache, overall discomfort, fatigue - and becomes highly contagious. No external signs yet indicate smallpox other than possible blisters forming in the mouth and throat. \n\nAfter three days of these flu-like symptoms, rashes begin to appear over the host's body. The victim typically is bedridden at this point. Within another day or two, many of these lesions turn into small blisters full of clear fluid; eight to nine days later these turn into scabs that eventually fall off. This final phase is when most fatalities occur. \n\nAs noted by [[Jessica Kandel|Dr. Jessica Kandel]], the virus contains traces from six separate pathogens: Dengue, Ebola, H1N1, Hantavirus, Marburg and Swine Flu (itself a strain of H1N1). This made it obvious that this virus was not naturally occurring but artificially created. Also, the Green Poison is designed\u00a0to survive for longer on non-organic surfaces such as the currency\u00a0used to spread the disease much more effectively, as a\u00a0Second Wave Division agent was able to recover still-contaminated currency from [[Broadway Emporium|Abel's Department Store]] in the Garment District of Manhattan.\n\nDue to the virus's ability to rapidly mutate, it is nearly impossible for conventional drugs or antibodies\u00a0to identify and exterminate the virus, let alone for a proper vaccine to the disease to be created. It also allows the virus to adapt to a diverse population range such as [[New York City]]. There are some people who are naturally immune to catching this virus, but they are largely in the minority and, as the virus is not symptomatic at first, people who could be immune are left to survive in quarantines and later [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zones]]. Also, it is revealed in [[Gordon Amherst|Amherst]]'s notes that he deliberately meant for the virus to have a mortality rate of\u00a080-90%, allowing some of the human population to survive.\n\nWhen people die of this virus, it is known as \"cashing out\" due to it being spread by money. The virus is also referred to as Dollar Pox, Money Pox, Wages of Sin, Buck Flu, Dollar Bug, Cash Pox, Small Bill and The Legal Tender.\n\nLater, by the time of ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]'' it is believed that\u00a0Amherst programmed the disease to \"burn out\"\u00a0after a certain\u00a0amount of time, therefore rendering contaminated areas later clear of the disease. Although there are exceptions such as former quarantined clinics and laboratories where bodies and samples have yet to be disposed of properly, making a second outbreak a huge risk.\n\nAlso, it is\u00a0discovered that [[Emeline Shaw]], the leader of the [[Outcasts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] is an [[Wikipedia:Asymptomatic_carrier|asymptomatic carrier]] of the disease, meaning she can infect other people in close proximity with the Dollar Flu but is not harmed or killed. It is unknown if this was intended by Amherst to happen.\n\n\n== History ==\n=== Engineering the Virus ===\nBelieving in his volatile Darwinian delusions about radically reducing the human population, [[Gordon Amherst|Dr. Gordon Amherst]] engineered a super virus using an industrial-grade\u00a0protein printer. The Green Poison is an amalgamation of various lethal diseases. Not only are they mixed up together, Dr. Amherst even genetically modified their incubation and infection rate, accelerating the infection rate. Owning up to his delusions, Dr.\u00a0Amherst later infected himself and accepted that if the virus decides to kill him, he will gladly \"see everyone in Hell\". \n\n\n=== The Outbreak of the Virus  ===\n[[Gordon Amherst|Dr. Gordon Amherst]] distributed the virus to the human population via infected dollar bills during the [[Wikipedia:Black_Friday_(shopping)|Black Friday]] shopping sales, ensuring a massive initial dispersion. Before people realized that it was a lethal epidemic, they believed it was just a particularly potent version of the annual flu season. When the threat of the pandemic became realized, [[CERA]], the newly minted [[Joint Task Force]], and the First Wave of activated [[Strategic Homeland Division]] agents were dispatched and attempted to stabilize the crisis. Unfortunately, efforts from all three organizations proved to be inadequate. The quarantine zone in Central Manhattan, where the virus and the brunt of the ensuing anarchy originated, proved too much to handle, later becoming the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]], and the worst of the virus is currently contained there.\n\nThe infection eventually spread out from the United States of America, infecting 147 countries around the world on every continent, becoming classed as a global pandemic. This was due to the quick infection rate along with [[New York City]] being one of the country's biggest tourist destinations and international travel hubs. Thus\u00a0before the whole\u00a0of New York City was quarantined, infected persons had already traveled across the globe and this was likely part of Amherst's plan.\n\n\n=== Events of Tom Clancy's The Division ===\nUnable to respond\u00a0with the chaos of the outbreak, the infrastructure of [[New York City]] has completely collapsed with the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] forced to retreat to their last stronghold of [[Camp Hudson]].\u00a0[[Jessica Kandel|Dr. Kandel]] is a CERA virologist who was deployed to the field\u00a0hospital at\u00a0[[Madison Field Hospital|Madison Square Garden]]\u00a0during the initial [[The Outbreak|outbreak]]. After being saved by the Second Wave of [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents dispatched to the city, she takes over the [[Medical Wing]] of the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]] and manages to research and\u00a0write various reports on the Green Poison. After receiving [[Broadway Emporium|viable samples]] of the original pathogen, she was able to conclude that it was indeed a manufactured weaponized disease created from Smallpox.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Vitaly Tchernenko]], a Russian virologist trapped inside the [[Russian Consulate]] in N.Y.C., decided to use the available resources to conduct extensive investigations\u00a0on the Green Poison, suspecting that it was made using techniques he himself had developed,\u00a0and to research all of its properties\u00a0to find methods of combating the virus. This research was eventually recovered by the Second Wave Division agents when they picked up his distress signal; however, during a gun battle between the Second Wave and newly discovered [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue agents]],\u00a0Tchernenko was abducted by their leader [[Aaron Keener]].\u00a0\n\nDuring the Second Wave's attack on the [[Last Man Battalion|LMB]]'s main stronghold at the [[United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]], Aaron Keener abandoned Lt. Col. [[Charles Bliss]] and the remaining rogue agents and escaped. After the LMB were destroyed and their leader killed, Agent [[Faye Lau]] of The Division started picking up a strange signal in an abandoned building near [[Camp Hudson]].\n\nFound there was a makeshift laboratory and the deceased body of [[Gordon Amherst|Dr. Gordon Amherst]], who was concluded to have died by deliberately infecting himself with his own virus. Also present was an\u00a0[[ECHO]] created by\u00a0Keener announcing to the Division that he possessed all of Amherst's equipment\u00a0and research used to create Green Poison, as well as Tchernenko to show him how to use it. He then attempted to entice further agents to go rogue and join him.\n\n\n=== Events of Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ===\nSeven months after the initial [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] in [[New York City]], most of the virus had\u00a0burned itself out and a potential cure had\u00a0been developed by virologists at the Ann Arbor Medical School using\u00a0the research conducted by [[Jessica Kandel|Dr. Kandel]], and the first viable inoculations shipped to\u00a0[[Washington, D.C.]] as a continuity of government measure. \n\nIn an attempt to eradicate the virus when it had spread to the nation's capital,\u00a0the federal government launched a\u00a0chemical\u00a0called [[DC-62]] to destroy the virus and sterilize any contaminated areas. However, it turned out DC-62 not only destroyed the virus, but was also extremely toxic to the point where even standing near to it in\u00a0close\u00a0proximity would cause lethal burns and even spontaneous death by breathing in the toxic fumes. DC-62 became the main reason why Washington, D.C. has [[D.C. Dark Zones|Dark Zones]].\n\nFurthermore,\u00a0when the initial pandemic broke out in Washington, D.C., the people who were infected by\u00a0Green Poison were quarantined on [[Roosevelt Island]]\u00a0by the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] under the command of\u00a0[[Antwon Ridgeway]], a former colonel in the Army National Guard\u00a0entrusted with making sure the entire quarantine ran smoothly and the infected people had medical attention. Seeing that the virus would eventually kill the infected despite all the medical care in the world, and losing faith\u00a0that the federal government could resolve the situation, Colonel Ridgeway decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nRidgeway's acted ruthlessly and, due to the chaotic state of the city, he was able to abuse his authority for a long time before the commander of the JTF found out and had him imprisoned. During this time, the victims of Ridgeway's mistreatment rose up against the remaining JTF maintaining the quarantine at Roosevelt Island and became a cult-like faction called the [[Outcasts]] under the leadership of [[Emeline Shaw]]. However, it did not take long until loyal members of Ridgeway's unit freed him, and\u00a0the [[True Sons]] were formed with a goal to kill all of the remaining infected and anybody who challenged them.\n\nMeanwhile, Shaw, a woman who was somehow an asymptomatic carrier of the Green Poison, desired vengeance for the horrible treatment she and her family received during the Roosevelt Island quarantine under Ridgeway's command. She riled up the remaining quarantined people, formed the Outcasts and persuaded them to use the remaining Green Poison within her own blood as a biological weapon\u00a0to spread the Green Poison to the uninfected survivors\u00a0in D.C. in revenge for the treatment they received during the quarantine of Roosevelt Island.\n\n[[ru:\u0417\u0435\u043b\u0451\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430]]\n[[Category:Content]]\n[[Category:The Division]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]",

This season's narrative has agents take on [[Captain Lewis]] of the [[True Sons]]  and his lieutenants: [[Major Castillo]], [[Sergeant Daniels]], [[Lieutenant Chang]] and [[Major Xander]]. In addition, the season adds 6 new Global Events, 4 new Leagues and 2 new Apparel Events. \n\n== Manhunt: Captain Lewis ==\n[[General Anderson]] of the [[True Sons]] is planning something big, and he has sent [[Captain Lewis]] and his advance team as his frontmen to Washington, D.C. to execute his plan. \n\n== Storyline ==\nIn the aftermath of ''[[End of Watch]]'', [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]] delivered [[Faye Lau|Faye Lau's]] body to helicopter for a proper burial at Haven. When she noticed that Lau's watch went orange, she swept through the building, learning that Lau had left an insurance policy in a laptop with encrypted files. \n\nIn the meantime, Division agents are alerted that the [[True Sons]] are making big moves in D.C under the command of [[General Anderson|General Peter Anderson]] with their mission being reclaiming their foothold in the capitol. As such, they had orders to eliminate [[Captain Lewis|Captain Frederick Lewis]] as well as his four lieutenants: [[Major Castillo|Major Malcom Castillo]], [[Sergeant Daniels|Sergeant Michelle Daniels]], [[Lieutenant Chang|Lieutenant Mackenzie Chang]], and [[Major Xander|Major Amanda Xander]].\n\nAfter the lieutenants were dealt with, the agents were alerted that Captain Lewis and his squad are fighting off [[Black Tusk]] in [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center]]. While they went there, they find that Lewis is the only survivor. Agents begrudingly worked with Lewis while he kept any Black Tusk away from the SHD node. The agents swept through the complex, eliminating many Black Tusk personnel, including Jack Bonney, the last of Bardon Schaeffer's original squad.  \n\nHowever, things get puzzling when it turns out Bonney had a smartwatch with ISAC identifying him as an Agent with classified status, and Lewis himself didn't provide any answers.\n\nEventually, the files in Faye's insurance policy get decrypted, revealing many things. [[Calvin McManus]], the Secretary of Homeland Security, is working with [[Natalya Sokolova]] and her Black Tusk. The [[Hunters]] work for Homeland. And [[Bardon Schaeffer]] worked secretly with Faye Lau to help warn the Division about the coming threat. It's why Schaeffer was at [[Coney Island Amusement Park (Manhunt: Schaeffer)|Coney Island]], to act as bait and have the Division capture him. \n\nHowever, with Schaeffer in a coma from his injuries back then, it's unknown whether he will wake up and share what he knows. Furthermore, it would seem that Anderson's True Sons mission on D.C wasn't just to secure a foothold, but to learn of any connection between Black Tusk and the Hunters after [[Linette \"Dusk\" Edwards]] died. This is further evidenced in the insurance files involving Sokolova and McManus, when the former requested for a Hunter to keep watch on Schaeffer's team during the events of ''[[Concealed Agenda]].''

The shocking street savagery combined with concern for Loved ones motivated many deserters to evacuate the city. Out of necessity, all remaining security teams ([[National Guard]], [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], [[CERA]]) banded together to form a single command center calling itself the Joint Task Force. Led by Captain [[Roy Benitez]], a veteran NYPD narcotics officer and one of the first responders to the 2001 9/11 attacks, the JTF is slowly pushing back the curtain of anarchy in New York. Their mission is to take back neighborhoods block by block, with The Division providing strategic leadership and tactical support.\n\n== Leadership ==\nWhat remains of the JTF is led by NYPD Captain [[Roy Benitez]]\u00a0in [[New York City]] and\u00a0[[Manny Ortega]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and by working in tandem with [[CERA]], the group was initially chartered with the purpose of curbing the spread of the virus, efficiently distributing aid supplies, and maintaining law and order; however, the organization's control quickly\u00a0disintegrated as the disease continued to spread and panic took hold in both cities.\n\nSince then, the JTF has been considerably weakened and decentralized due to the incessant threat of several hostile [[:Category:Factions|factions]], having been relegated to a small handful of safe houses and bases throughout the cities.\n\n\n=== New York City ===\n* [[Roy Benitez]] - Commander of the JTF's forces in New York City.\n* [[Jessica Kandel]] - Head doctor and virologist in New York City.\n* [[Paul Rhodes]] - Former lead technician and engineer in New York City.\n\n=== Washington, D.C. ===\n* [[Manny Ortega]] - Division Coordinator and leader of the surviving JTF in Washington, D.C.\n* [[Antwon Ridgeway]] - Former Colonel of the JTF in D.C.; later mutineer and founder of the [[True Sons]].\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Intelligence Brief ==\n[[File:Tc-the-division-faction-joint-task-force-intelligence-brief.jpg|thumb|right|378x378px]]\nThe JTF was formed by order of [[President Waller]]; it consists of local, state, and federal emergency services and military agencies including the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]], and\u00a0the [[Wikipedia:United States National Guard|National Guard]]. Later, when the [[Green Poison|virus]] was discovered to have spread to [[Washington, D.C.]], they formed a similar JTF under\u00a0full military control.\u00a0Understaffed and overworked with meager resources, they have been stretched thin to say the least. As ensuing unrest decimated their ranks, the JTF lost control, leaving the cities\u00a0to turn into lawless death-traps for all its citizens.\n\nUnable to effectively coordinate and manage the response, the JTF now puts their hope in the members of [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]] to lead the way. As such, all Division agents are strongly encouraged to assist the JTF, wherever possible, whether it's protecting supply drops or aiding civilians in need. Troops are scattered around [[New York City|New York]] and are ready to assist Division agents or be assisted by them. Most men and women are tasked to protect the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]] and any remaining secure locations like [[Camp Hudson]] while few of them are in charge of gathering information and reconnaissance and sending this data to SHD. The JTF also man various checkpoints throughout the city and sends out patrols whenever possible in order to increase stability and security all around New York City.\n\nBy the time of the events of ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]'', the JTF units stationed in [[Washington, D.C.]] have all but collapsed. A large-scale mutiny led by [[Antwon Ridgeway]] saw the creation of a hostile splinter faction known as the [[True Sons]]. The majority of JTF volunteers who remained loyal to the U.S. government were evacuated elsewhere under Presidential orders, with only a skeleton crew staying behind to keep [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]] operational, either as guards around the perimeter or as support and technical crews in\u00a0the interior. Most of their original functions have been taken over by the [[Civilian Militia]] of the [[Settlements|D.C. Settlements]], a National Guard Signalist,\u00a0[[Manny Ortega]] leads what remains of the JTF and coordinates with The Division to help the agents out in the ongoing quest to restore government control of the city.\n\nThe JTF work with [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]] and the allied Civilian Militia to combat the growing threat of the [[True Sons]], the [[Hyenas]], and the [[Outcasts]]. After those factions are successfully dismantled, Washington is suddenly attacked by an invading force of\u00a0private military contractors and mercenaries, the [[Black Tusk]].\n\n\n== Known JTF Members ==\n{{JTF}}\n\n\n== Events prior to Tom Clancy's The Division ==\nInitially, [[New York City]] served as the ground zero for the [[Green Poison|Dollar Flu]] outbreak. Not understanding how devastating the virus was initially, JTF leadership badly butchered the governmental response to the outbreak. The situation eventually escalated out of control, and for the first time in American history, one of their cities was placed under lockdown. To make matters worse, [[Rikers |prisoners at Rikers Island]] were able to escape and make it onto the mainland, further amplifying the violence already spreading through the city. From then on, chaos spread further as JTF forces, already stretched thin, were unable to deal with the newly escaped prisoners and the virus. [[President Waller]], under the counseling of his cabinet, activated the first wave of Division agents to provide reinforcements to the struggling JTF forces.\n\nNow reinforced by Division agents, the JTF were able to restore some semblance of control over the city, segregating infected individuals into areas that would eventually be known as [[Dark Zones]]. In addition, the JTF leadership was able to broker a deal with the [[Last Man Battalion]], who would assist them in securing New York. This alliance would eventually collapse in a matter of weeks as both sides disagreed with each other's methods.\n\nFurther unrest and a lack of a solution to the virus would undo all the progress that JTF forces had desperately tried to maintain. Eventually, a lack of morale and a lack of manpower proved fatal to JTF forces as their leadership ordered that they abandon the Dark Zones to its fate. First Wave Division agents who were caught off-guard by the JTF's sudden withdrawal begun going [[Rogue Status|rogue]], believing that their government had abandoned them. In their haste to abandon the Dark Zones, the JTF left behind many valuable assets, such as weapons and equipment. Now scattered and in disarray, the remaining JTF forces abandoned much of the city and pulled back the majority of their forces into safe areas.\n\nIn [[Washington, D.C.]], another outbreak occurred and a similar JTF was formed under military control. However, the situation proved to be even worse than the one in New York, leading to the declaration of martial law as the JTF struggled to place infected civilians into designated quarantine zones. Eventually, things would reach a boiling point as civilians begun rioting. To make matters worse, [[Antwon Ridgeway]], a colonel in the JTF, begun executing and starving infected citizens, believing that they were as good as dead. The JTF leadership soon caught wind of his actions and jailed him; however, staunch loyalists from his unit broke him out and mutinied against the JTF. The JTF in Washington, D.C., deciding that the capital was a lost cause, retreated to other areas of the country while leaving a skeleton crew to defend and maintain The White House. For all intents and purposes, the JTF had collapsed, leaving the remaining civilian population without an organized force for protection and security.\n\n\n== Events of Tom Clancy's The Division ==\nOutgunned and outnumbered, the JTF were unable to maintain order in the city. Eventually, the Second Wave of [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents was activated and had begun to restore order in [[Brooklyn]], wiping out Rioters and regaining control of the island. Meanwhile, the sole commander of the New York JTF forces, [[Roy Benitez]], had departed the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]] to try and secure the [[Lincoln Tunnel Checkpoint]], as [[Rioters]] were trying to blow up the floodgate in order to escape Manhattan. If they succeeded, the Lincoln Tunnel would be flooded and the JTF would lose a major supply line.\n\nAs Division agents were departing Brooklyn for Manhattan, an [[Last Man Battalion|LMB]] SAM (surface-to-air missile) wiped out a majority of Second Wave Division agents, as well as their leader, [[Louis Chang]]. With only two agents barely surviving the horrific attack, the JTF deployed a rescue team to fly them to [[Camp Hudson]], Manhattan for medical treatment.\n\nBeginning operations there, the Division agents soon rescued the JTF forces at the struggling Base of Operations against Rioters and took de facto command of the JTF forces in the absence of Captain Benitez. Within days, The Division quickly mobilized and rescued [[Jessica Kandel]], [[Roy Benitez|Captain Benitez]] and [[Paul Rhodes]]. Their rescue and subsequent arrival to the Base of Operations proved to be a major boost in morale as they begun coordinating JTF forces to retake the city.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, both The Division and JTF retook much of the city block-by-block and eliminated the leadership of each faction, crippling them and effectively turning the tide of the JTF's previously failing fortunes. [[Faye Lau]] even mentions that civilians felt much safer to come out due to the consistent JTF patrols and their presence assuring them of their safety.\n\nEventually, after crippling major LMB operations, they finally began preparing an assault against their headquarters at the [[United Nations HQ|U.N. Building]]. The JTF played a secondary yet vital role in preventing the LMB reinforcements from attacking the infiltrating Division agents, eventually winning the battle after a lengthy fight.\n\nAs each of the factions begun destabilizing, the JTF took advantage of the opportunity to redeploy into previously abandoned districts, including investigating missing persons reports that were put on the back- burner due to the JTF's previously underwhelming strength.\n\nHowever, the JTF intelligence received reports of LMB forces gathering in one of their underground bases and deployed several squads to investigate the reports, but not before losing contact with them and deploying Division agents in their stead. After their success, however, the remaining factions united in a last-ditch attempt to wipe out the JTF and Division agents, only to fail miserably and eventually disband.\n\n\n== Events of Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ==\n=== Washington, D.C. ===\nSometime between spring and early summer, the bulk of the [[Washington, D.C.]] JTF force evacuated the city. The skeleton crew left behind in D.C. were unable to carry out further operations beyond guarding and maintaining [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]] due to a lack of manpower, and as a result, the responsibility of defending the city was left to the [[Civilian Militia]]. Although the JTF assisted the civilian settlements in any way possible, the extent of their help was limited. Eventually, a covert attack was launched by the [[Black Tusk]] onto the [[SHD Network]], leaving Division operations crippled nationwide. In response, Division agents began converging on the nation's capital, hoping to find out what happened to the SHD Network and restore it.\n\nOne notable agent arrived in D.C. after the civilian settlement where they were stationed at was attacked by Black Tusk forces just as the network went down. As they arrived, [[Hyenas|Hyena]] forces launched an attack on [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]]. The agent then assisted the outnumbered JTF forces in repelling them successfully. Linking up with the Division coordinator, [[Manny Ortega]], \"The Sheriff\" began visiting the different settlements, rallying the Civilian Militia to assist the beaten JTF forces. Having rescued [[Eleanor Sawyer]], Theatre leader [[Odessa Sawyer|Odessa Sawyer's]] daughter, \"The Sheriff\" earned the [[Theater Settlement]]'s goodwill, agreeing to help them in their fight against the other factions. Unfortunately, days later, the White House received a mayday request from the [[Castle Settlement]], and Division agent [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]] was sent to assess the situation. Contact with her was soon lost after she arrived, where \"The Sheriff\" was then sent to find out what happened. Upon arrival, it is soon found out that the entire Castle Settlement was wiped out, hit by a chemical attack by [[True Sons|True Son]] forces. Angered, Agent Kelso ordered \"The Sheriff\" to hunt down those responsible. In addition, JTF forces discovered that the Hyenas were holding [[President Ellis]] hostage, and with the efforts of \"The Sheriff\", they were able to evacuate him back to The White House. \n\nEventually, \"The Sheriff\" began hunting down each faction's different leaders, storming the [[District Union Arena|Union District Arena]] to hunt down much of the [[Hyena Council]] and battling through the [[Roosevelt Island]] stronghold of the [[Outcasts]] only to just barely fail to capture their leader, [[Emeline Shaw]]. \"The Sheriff's\" hard work had paid off, morale had returned within members of the JTF and their allies, gaining enough manpower and support to launch a joint operation with Division agents and the Civilian Militia against the True Sons stronghold in the [[Capitol Building|U.S. Capitol Building]] to recover the [[Broad-Spectrum Antiviral|anti-virals]]. With [[Antwon Ridgeway|General Ridgeway]] killed, much of the remaining True Sons surrendered or fled in scattered groups, no longer able to organize effectively as they once could previously.\n\nWith victory guaranteed, JTF and other allied forces began celebrating yet, concurrently and unbeknownst to them, [[Black Tusk]] forces began storming the nation's capitol, effectively reversing much of the JTF and Division's progress in the previous weeks. Caught off-guard, the JTF and Civilian Militia occupying the different strongholds were wiped out, with the settlements put under lockdown by the Black Tusk. In addition, [[President Ellis]] had disappeared during the chaos along with the [[Broad-Spectrum Antiviral|anti-virals]], with the JTF continuing to operate under the assumption that he had been kidnapped. However, in reality, he was working with the Black Tusk all along, having coordinated with BTSU leader [[Bardon Schaeffer]] to take over the capital.\n\nThe JTF did not collapse as BTSU higher-ups had hoped and still continued their stubborn resistance and attempts to regain control of the anti-virals. The JTF continued to operate under the auspices of Division command, where [[Manny Ortega]] began rapidly coordinating whatever assets he could spare to assist two of the remaining field agents left standing: Agent Kelso and \"The Sheriff\". Placing much of their faith in \"The Sheriff\", the JTF knew that they would not let them down and continued working around the clock, providing assistance when needed.\n\nTheir faith eventually paid off as \"The Sheriff\" rapidly crippled BTSU operations, inflicting such casualties that BTSU higher-ups were completely caught off-guard, proving unable to replenish their forces in time. Re-energized by \"The Sheriff's\" efforts, the JTF launched an all-out assault against the BTSU stronghold at [[Tidal Basin]], using support teams and helicopters to secure the anti-virals and ward off and Black Tusk reinforcements. As they observed \"The Sheriff\" approaching the landing craft, a JTF helicopter was sent to assist them but was shot down just as it arrived, crashing into the rotors. Out of options and getting desperate, BTSU operator \"[[Milla \"Wyvern\" Radek|Wyvern]]\" decided to launch a missile attack on the White House, directly defying the explicit orders of BTSU leader Bardon Schaeffer. However, \"The Sheriff\" was able to eliminate \"Wyvern\" and halt the missile strike in the nick of time and recover the stolen anti-virals.\n\nWhile much of the Black Tusk elite members were eliminated, the BTSU still had a technological edge over the JTF, however, with much of their manpower depleted, the JTF and the allied forces at least had a fighting chance against them. The vast majority of the BTSU were recalled from the capital, deciding to re-focus much of their remaining forces elsewhere, but occasionally sent an invasion force to try and recapture the Tidal Basin stronghold.\n\nDespite the major defeat of BTSU forces, the JTF received an unexpected alert from The Pentagon, where they found out Black Tusk forces were planning to extract equipment that could potentially mass-produce the anti-virals. Unwilling to allow such vital equipment to fall in enemy hands, the JTF sent \"The Sheriff\" to the site, who promptly began wiping out Black Tusk forces at the site, recovering the equipment in the process.\n\nSome weeks after their victory, [[Aaron Keener]] resurfaced, this time at [[Coney Island]] and was mysteriously in an apparent alliance with Black Tusk forces. This discovery alarmed Division higher ups and \"The Sheriff\" was sent to eliminate Keener and rescue virologist [[Vitaly Tchernenko]], who had gone missing since Keener kidnapped him from the [[Russian Consulate]]. As \"The Sheriff\" ravaged much of the Black Tusk forces, they successfully extracted the Russian virologist, having dealt with both Black Tusk field commander [[Dolores Jones]] and partially aided with the unexpected arrival of the [[Cleaners]], operating under the direction of Keener's rogue agent cell. Yet Keener had slipped out of their grasps once more, leaving Division agents frustrated at their failure.\n\nAnother few weeks passed by when JTF and Division command received a distress call from their branches in [[New York City]], deploying \"The Sheriff\" and Agent Kelso to assist them.\n\n\n== Warlords of New York ==\n=== New York City ===\nWith much of the violence winding down and a sense of stability returning to the city, the JTF lowered their guard, sending less patrols to patrol the streets. This would prove to be a fatal mistake when the other factions, like the [[Rikers]], exploited their vulnerability. [[Heather Lau]], acting Division commander [[Faye Lau]]'s sister, was amongst those killed during one of such attacks by [[Rikers]]. In addition, [[Aaron Keener]], having escaped from the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division's]] clutches, recruited different [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Agents]] who would begin manipulating the crippled factions by providing them with equipment to effectively combat the JTF forces.\n\nThese resurgent attacks by the once-crippled factions proved to have a devastating effect on the morale in the JTF. Having lost faith in the JTF's ability to protect them, many civilians and former personnel, including [[Paul Rhodes]], eventually began leaving to form their own settlements and rejected assistance from the Division, believing that they only served to ensure even more chaos. Keener eventually launched a coordinated attack against the JTF and Division at their base of operations at [[City Hall]], and they soon lost their foothold in [[Lower Manhattan]] to both [[Rikers]] and the [[Cleaners]], both now led by Rogue Agents.\n\nPresumably a few months before the events of Warlords of New York, both the JTF and Division seemed to be in a much stronger spot than their Washington counterparts, achieving a somewhat stable peace in New York. However, when [[Aaron Keener]] re-entered the city, things began to spiral downhill. With his recruitment of four fellow Rogue Agents, the city's fragile peace began to relapse as old threats resurged. The Cleaners, now rallied and organized under [[Vivian Conley]], begun sniffing out JTF operations that involved treating the sick, as well as being generally hostile to any JTF patrols. The Rikers also began making a rebound under [[James Dragov]], who stockpiled weapons and supplies for his growing 'family.' Rogue Agent [[Javier Kajika]] especially had bloodlust for the JTF, working in conjunction with the Cleaners and Keener to actively hunt down JTF officials and patrols who he believed were responsible for leaving him for dead. As the JTF began to collapse in Lower Manhattan, Keener finally delivered the final blow with his new bioweapon: the [[Eclipse Virus|Eclipse]] virus. Keener, in par with his coalition of rogue agents, attacked the JTF and Division Base of Operations at [[City Hall]], effectively destroying the installation. However, Keener did not stop there. Keener also showcased the Eclipse virus at the JTF base at [[Castle Clinton]], leaving only one survivor, Dan Abbat. The JTF shelter in the [[Two Bridges]] area was also torched by the Cleaners, most likely under the belief that the JTF were treating the sick. As of now, the JTF presence in Lower Manhattan has been severely diminished with the arrival of the rogue agents, with surviving personnel either joining the [[Peacekeepers]] or are operating at installations in other parts of the city.\n\n\n==Gameplay==\n=== The Division/Midtown Manhattan, New York City ===\nJTF members fill the role with allies. They can be seen stationed at checkpoints, guarding certain areas, patrolling the streets, and will be used in certain [[Missions in Tom Clancy's The Division|Missions]] and [[Encounters]]. However, it is unwise for players to rely on any JTF that assists them in combat even against low level [[Rioters]]. High level enemies, or even large enough numbers of enemies, can chew through squads of JTF if not dealt with. They infrequently engage targets, but their attacks are usually inaccurate and deal very little damage. However, they can kill low level Rioters if there are 2-3 of them.\n\nThey also lack unit [[Enemy Archetypes|archetypes]] such as engineer, heavy weapons, and sniper thus reducing the JTF's ability to counter most enemy types in-game.\n\nThey should not be underestimated, however. Despite their low damage output, they are fairly durable and can suppress and distract enemies, which can prove invaluable to the player even in most dire circumstances.\n\nAbandoned JTF vehicles ranging from police cars to armored transports can be spotted throughout the city. More often than not, the corpses of dead JTF personnel are a very common sight. Whether it be death from entanglements with the [[Rioters]], brutally murdered by [[Rikers]], or executed by [[Last Man Battalion]] firing squads.\n\nAfter finishing a quest or encounter, the location will permanently become a JTF checkpoint, and 2-4 troopers will occupy the area and occasionally engage passing enemies.\n\n\n=== Lower Manhattan, New York/Warlords of New York ===\nThe JTF, as an independent organization, does not play a significant role in ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2''<nowiki/>'s Warlords of New York. Units in [[Lower Manhattan]] have either collapsed with the loss of [[City Hall]] or have joined the [[Peacekeepers]], a civilian and JTF militia. JTF members can be found patrolling the streets of Lower Manhattan in par with civilians, and can also be seen at their settlement, [[Haven]]. Although it is hinted the JTF has other installations in other parts of the city, the JTF is no longer properly operating in Lower Manhattan. However, the JTF do play larger roles in a couple of missions:\n*[[Javier Kajika|Javier Kajika Manhunt]]: [[Quarantined Skyscraper]] - While investigating a Peacekeeper distress beacon, the agent discovers the bodies of a few dead JTF members along with a few burnt-out police cars.\n*[[Javier Kajika|Javier Kajika Manhunt]]: [[Hugh Carey Tunnel]] - The agent is sent to investigate a missing JTF patrol last seen investigating tremors at the [[Hugh Carey Tunnel]]. It is soon revealed through an [[ECHO]] that three of the four JTF soldiers in the patrol were burned alive by the [[Cleaners]], with the only surviving member of the patrol, John Bronson, being captured and taken to [[Pathway Park]] under Kajika's orders. Bronson is soon executed by Kajika at the beginning of his final mission.\n*Side Mission: [[Castle Clinton]] - The agent is asked to investigate [[Eclipse Virus|billowing red smoke]] at the JTF base in Castle Clinton. Upon arrival, it is revealed that the base has been overrun with Cleaners. After taking out the Cleaners guarding the entrance of the base, the player proceeds inside the base, where they then assist Dan Abbat, a surviving JTF soldier from the base. After Dan reveals the smoke came from a [[CERA]] supply crate in the courtyard, the agent investigates further, taking out more Cleaners. After the area is secured, [[ISAC]] is able to gather enough data from the base's security systems to put together an [[ECHO]] as to how the smoke materialized in the base. In the ECHO, it is soon revealed that the JTF soldiers stationed in the base unknowingly opened up the crate, believing it was a CERA supply cache, only to then be exposed to the horrific effects of [[Aaron Keener|Keener's]] bioweapon. After the majority of JTF soldiers are killed by the bioweapon, the Cleaners are then sent in to clean up any survivors and secure the area.\n*[[Vivian Conley|Vivian Conley Manhunt]]: [[JTF Shelter]] - The agent is sent in response to an attack on a JTF shelter in the [[Two Bridges]] district. It is soon revealed that all of the JTF and civilians in the shelter have been killed at the hands of Vivian Conley and her Cleaners, presumably for treating the sick. \n\n\n=== Washington, D.C. ===\nIn\u00a0''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'', the JTF units stationed in [[Washington, D.C.]] have all but collapsed, with personnel either evacuating or joining the [[True Sons]]. Now, JTF personnel just act as NPC's guarding and working at\u00a0[[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]]. They are not seen anywhere else in the open world, as their patrol and assist duties and been replaced by [[Civilian Militia]]. The JTF members that staff the White House appear to be a combination of national guardsmen, as well as members of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. The bodies of JTF members can also be found throughout the city, like outside the White House's eastern checkpoint and at [[The Cinderblock]] Control Point, with many others being scattered throughout miscellaneous parts of the city.\n\nJTF personnel use DCPD police cars, armored Humvees, army transportation trucks, UH-60 Black Hawks and UH-72 Lakota helicopters as transportation.\n\nThough during some missions, the JTF does play a larger role than usual:\n*The most prevalent role the JTF play in ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'' is the pickup and extraction of agents and objects ([[Tidal Basin|anti-virals]], [[DARPA Research Labs|Fusion Bioreactor]]) via helicopter in main missions, strongholds and [[Dark Zones|Dark Zone]] extractions. JTF pilots usually fly UH-72 U.S. Army Lakota helicopters.\n*[[Camp White Oak]]: JTF forces attempt to secure a helipad to ensure that [[President Ellis]] does not avoid Division capture; at the end, they fail, and their attacking forces are wiped out by the [[Black Tusk]].\n**In the [[Camp White Oak (Invaded)|invaded version of the mission]], the agent is sent back to Camp White Oak after a JTF forensics team is attacked by a Black Tusk contingent force (as well as candidates for [[Bardon Schaeffer|Bardon Schaeffer's]] Black Tusk unit) attempting to destroy valuable intel. As the agent progresses through the mission, both JTF and Black Tusk comms indicate an increasingly hectic situation for the JTF, with the Black Tusk ultimately overrunning the JTF force. In the end, the agent arrives too late to save any members of the JTF.\n*[[Kenley College]]: A JTF convoy carrying important equipment was attacked and destroyed by Outcasts. [[Jack Arnold]], a JTF engineer with the supply convoy heading to D.C., was taken as prisoner by the [[Outcasts]] to help them set up their IEDs after they ambush the convoy and overwhelm JTF forces. Arnold is later rescued and protected by Division agents.\n*[[Tidal Basin]]: A JTF support team lead by an unnamed JTF engineer, assisted by other JTF soldiers and defended by Division agents, helps open up the inner gate of the stronghold, allowing agents to head in and secure the [[Broad-Spectrum Antiviral]] samples from the Black Tusk. JTF forces also move in to secure the antivirals once the Black Tusk forces are neutralized by Division agents. The brave JTF pilot of Thunderbird One also played a heroic role in securing the remaining antivirals, with the pilot purposefully crashing into the rotors of the Black Tusk's hovercraft. This crippled the boat's motor capabilities, prompting [[Milla \"Wyvern\" Radek]] to stand her ground and fight The Division instead of evacuating by foot.\n*[[Coney Island]]: JTF drone operator [[Cindy McAllister]] was deployed to assist the agent in securing [[Vitaly Tchernenko]] by updating the agent on the current situation of the park. Later on in the mission, after [[ISAC]] hacks into a Black Tusk mortar system, McAllister uses the Black Tusk mortars to help clear a path for the agent. McAllister also helped the agent in intercepting and eliminating Dolores Jones while dealing with Cleaners and Black Tusk.\n*[[Mexican Embassy Crash Site|Mexican Embassy]] ([[Classified Assignments|Classified Assignment]]): The JTF was doing a supply run at the Mexican Embassy when the Outcasts shot down their Chinook helicopter. The agent must secure the embassy, reach the downed helo, and rescue JTF pilot [[John Yazzie]].\n\n\n== JTF Types ==\n=== New York City ===\nIn N.Y.C., one could tell if someone is part of the JTF by looking out for their green vests and headwear.\n* NYPD Police Officer - Armed with [[MP5]] sub machine guns, [[M870]] shotguns and [[PF45]] handguns. Usually with blue police garb.\n*National Guardsman - Armed with [[M4]] assault rifles, [[Super 90]] shotguns and [[M9]] handguns. Always sporting Army ACUs.\n*JTF Pilot - JTF pilots are only seen on certain missions and in Dark Zone extractions. JTF pilots have been seen to fly dark green UH-72 Lakota helicopters brandishing the \"U.S. Army\" logo, as well as news helicopters. JTF pilots sport a dark green pilot helmet with a white stripe running down the middle and supposedly wear army ACUs with a signature JTF green vest.\n*HAZMAT JTF - HAZMAT JTF can be found in contaminated zones, Dark Zones and decontamination zones, like the decontamination checkpoint at the entrance of [[Camp Hudson]] and in the isolation ward of the Base of Operations. The HAZMAT JTF do not play a significant part in the game whatsoever, usually just working in the background of safe zones. Dead HAZMAT JTF are a common sight in the Dark Zone and contaminated zones, usually slumped over ambulances or lying dead in the middle of infected zones. HAZMAT JTF can be easily identified with their full-yellow HAZMAT suits and a signature green JTF vest topping the suit off.\n\n=== Washington, D.C. ===\nIn D.C., one can tell if someone is a JTF member by looking at the back of their T-shirts, which will have \"JTF\" printed on them.\n* Sentry Guards - Armed with various rifles and assault rifles, these personnel are stationed at most entrances, checkpoints and guard towers around the White House. Their appearances vary, wearing a mix of white T-shirts with the DCPD and JTF logo, olive green T-shirts with the JTF logo, camouflage green cargo pants or dark blue cargo pants (both with holsters).\n* Maintenance/Support Crew - These personnel make up the bulk of the D.C. JTF Force, working and operating in the interior of The White House. Their tasks consist of maintaining the SHD servers in the basement, routinely radioing [[Settlements]] to check on their situations, gathering intel on the current state of the city and taking stock on supplies. Maintenance personnel also perform other minor chores in The White House, such as cleaning or maintaining equipment. Maintenance and support crews wear a mix of white T-shirts with the DCPD and JTF logo, olive green T-shirts with the JTF logo, camouflage green cargo pants or dark blue cargo pants (both with holsters).\n* JTF Pilot - JTF pilots in Washington play larger roles than in the first game, making appearances in a number of missions, strongholds and in [[D.C. Dark Zones|Dark Zone]] extractions.

They all share the same green helmets and vests, but police wear blue uniforms underneath, while national guardsmen wear army uniforms.\n** Some members of the JTF in uniform may be civilians recruited after the outbreak, however. This is evidenced by the fact that some JTF Officers, such as Anthony Zappa and JB Keller, wear uniforms but claim to have had professions other than police or guardsmen. In ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'', several ECHOs revealed JTF members with backgrounds including security guards for federal museums and monuments.\n** According to the [[ECHOs]], the JTF also includes Marine Corps personnel in their ranks. As National Guardsmen are technically U.S. Army personnel, it is likely that much of the National Guard was federalized to form the JTF. \n* If the player purchases the JTF Outfit Bundle from the Premium Vendor in the first game, they will get the National Guardsman design (albeit the helmet and vest part of the jacket is a lighter shade of green, and the camouflage pattern on the fatigues is slightly different). The helmet returns in ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'', although only as a prop rather than as a cosmetic item. Another JTF outfit appears in the apparel store of ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'', but it does not match any previously seen JTF uniforms, possibly using the U.S. Woodland pattern (1981-2005) or an odd variation of the Operational Camouflage Pattern (standard issue U.S. Army camouflage post-2019) rather than the Universal Camouflage Pattern (Army digital from 2005-2019). Another piece of store apparel, the Field Operative pants, uses the U.S. Navy \"blueberry\" digital patter.\n* If an agent discharges their firearm near a JTF patrol or soldier, they will flinch, look at the player, and call them out on it. Similarly, they will call out an agent if they're caught aiming their weapon at them.\n** In ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'', JTF members at the White House may sometimes sling their weapons and salute the agent.\n* In ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ''and ''Warlords of New York, ''the JTF have multiple designs. In ECHOs found throughout Washington, D.C., JTF soldiers are seen wearing the same uniform as the National Guard JTF during ''Tom Clancy's The Division'', but troops at the White House simply wear T-shirts and police or army pants''. ''In the cutscene that plays when the agent plays back the surveillance footage from City Hall in New York, both the National Guard and police variants from ''Tom Clancy's The Division'' are seen guarding the entrance to the BOO, but all of the corpses in the Town Hall are the casual T-shirt variants.\n** Certain JTF pilots in ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'' (i.e., Dark Zone extraction pilots) seem to retain their uniforms from the previous game, while others use entirely new uniforms (such as the ''Warlords of New York'' pilot) or the casual attire of the White House JTF (such as the main Helipad pilot). \n** At Castle Clinton, a JTF survivor named Dan Abbat can be seen wearing the JTF casual attire (police version) with a camouflage vest. At the beginning of Javier Kajika's final mission, Kajika is seen executing the final member of a JTF patrol, [[John Bronson]]. Upon further inspection of Bronson's body, he is wearing UCP Army Combat Uniform pants and a matching cap, as well as UCP-Delta (an extremely limited issue, short-lived pattern) body armor over a green JTF vest (similar to Peacekeeper control point officers). In other ECHOs seen throughout Lower Manhattan, like the Hugh Carey Tunnel ECHO, the Castle Clinton ECHO, and the Pathway ECHO, JTF soldiers are seen wearing several different types of body armor over their casual attire. \n** Some Peacekeepers can be seen with National Guard pants, although the camouflage color is much more orange or brown rather than the normal greens and greys.\n* In ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'', although police armor and helmets appear in The White House, JTF NPCs were not seen wearing any body armor until ''Warlords of New York'' was released.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]'' ([[Warlords of New York]] Expansion)\n[[es:Joint Task Force]]\n[[ru:\u041e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0451\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0413\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430]]\n[[Category:Factions]]\n[[Category:Allies]]\n[[Category:The Division]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:The Division Resurgence]]",

This is a device that allows grenades to be propelled through the air at a much larger range than throwing distance. This launcher can hold six grenades in it at once and said grenades deal damage to any enemy caught in the blast radius.

This is a variant of the standard [[Turret]] that launches artillery shells at a designated area. Once deployed, the agent must designate an area for bombardment. Otherwise, the turret will just sit there unused.\n\n=== Fragmentation Grenade ===\nThe Fragmentation Grenade is unique to the Demolitionist.

  "Medkit": "[[File:Medkits.png|thumb|right|200px]]'''Medkits''' are a type of consumable item featured in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''. They are used as healing items by the [[Strategic Homeland Division]] and various hostile factions. In ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]], ''Medkits are replaced by [[Armor Plates|Armor Kits]]. \n\n==Overview==\nKnown among Division agents as \"combat cocktails\", Medkits are a type of cutting-edge [[SHD Tech]]--filled with anabolic steroids, antibiotics, and painkillers, they are designed to provide an instant boost of strength and stamina. They make it possible to function in spite of grievous wounds, but with the delayed cost of terrible withdrawals and a high risk of addiction. Agents with medical training, such as [[Colin Harrison]], consider them a tool of last resort.\n\nBeneath their armor, [[Hunters]] receive a steady flow of chemicals similar to those found in Medkits, tailored for each individual's metabolism. This gives them extreme endurance and complete disregard for pain while avoiding the worst withdrawal symptoms.\n==Gameplay==\n===''Tom Clancy's The Division''===\nMedkits are a consumable item that instantly refills a portion of the user's missing health bar, followed by a brief period of additional health regeneration. After using a Medkit, there is a 10-second timer before another can be used; this does not affect other sources of healing, such as [[First Aid]] or [[Support Station|Support Stations]]. Additional medkits can be obtained as loot from enemies and containers, and are completely restocked from [[Resupply Caches]] in [[Safe Houses]] and the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]]. \n\nInitially, agents are limited to carrying two (2) Medkits. This capacity can be increased up to five (5) Medkits by acquiring the '''Medkits''' [[Perks in Tom Clancy's The Division|Perks]] at the Base of Operations, and up to seven (7) Medkits by equipping the [[Paramedic Gear Set|Paramedic Backpack]]. Named enemies and Hunters also carry a limited number of Medkits, which fully replenish their health and armor after a delay.\n\n[[Civilians]] in need may request a Medkit; if given one, they will drop a {{Vanity|Vanity}} item or a {{Standard|Rarity|Standard}}, {{Specialized|Rarity|Specialized}}, or {{Superior|Rarity|Superior}} weapon, gear piece, or mod.\n==== Survival ====\nIn [[Survival]], besides their normal properties, Medkits are necessary to revive other downed or unconscious agents, and can also be used to self-revive while in a downed state. Self-reviving is not possible if:\n\n* An agent's bleedout timer expires, either naturally or from being attacked while downed\n* An agent falls unconscious while Freezing\n* An agent's infection timer expires\n* An agent is executed by a Hunter\n\nInitially, agents are limited to carrying two (2) Medkits. This capacity can be increased up to three (3) Medkits by crafting the '''Additional Medkit Pouch''' at a Crafting Table. Additional medkits can be obtained as loot from enemies and containers, and can be crafted using the following blueprints:\n\n* '''Medkit''': 1x [[File:Cloth.png|20px]] {{Specialized|Rarity|Fabric}}, 1x [[File:Tools.png|20px]] {{Specialized|Rarity|Tools}}\n* '''Medkit (High-End Materials)''': 1x [[File:Cloth.png|20px]] {{High-end|Rarity|Fabric}}\n\nThe following [[Skills|Skill]] blueprints also use Medkits as crafting material:\n\n* '''First Aid''': 3x [[File:Electronics icon.png|20px]] {{Specialized|Rarity|Electronics}}, 1x Medkit, 1x [[File:Tools.png|20px]] {{Specialized|Rarity|Tools}}\n* '''Support Station''': 3x [[File:Electronics icon.png|20px]] {{Specialized|Rarity|Electronics}}, 1x Medkit, 1x [[File:Tools.png|20px]] {{Specialized|Rarity|Tools}}\n* '''First Aid (High-End Materials)''': 2x [[File:Electronics icon.png|20px]] {{High-end|Rarity|Electronics}}, 1x Medkit\n* '''Support Station (High-End Materials)''': 2x [[File:Electronics icon.png|20px]] {{High-end|Rarity|Electronics}}, 1x Medkit\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n*''[[Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division: Recruited]]''\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Compromised]]''\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Hunted]]''\n[[Category:Consumables]]\n[[Category:Equipment]]\n[[Category:SHD Tech]]",
  "SHD Tech": "{{Gadgets\n|name  = <center>SHD Tech</center>\n|image = SHD Devices.png\n|type  = Strategic Homeland Division Technology\n|role  = SHD Tech provides high-value real-time<br/>intelligence for Division agents engaged in the field operations\n|users = [[Strategic Homeland Division]]<br/>[[Rogue Division Agents]]}}'''SHD Tech''' (pronounced \u201cShade Tech\u201d) is a shorthand for \"Strategic Homeland Division Technology\".\n\nOne of the [[Strategic Homeland Division]]'s biggest advantages in the field is its revolutionary smart technology. Linked together into an intelligent grid by the SHD global satellite network, SHD Tech provides high-value, real-time intelligence for Division agents engaged in field operations.\n\nDeveloped either exclusively by the Division's Research & Development department or adapted from military or commercial technological prototypes, SHD Tech is actually a catch-all term for all proprietary assets and systems employed exclusively by the Division and its agents. These include some of the most innovative augmented reality (AR) systems ever developed for policing or military actions: pod launchers, turrets, retractable ballistic shields, seeker mines and portable stations, to name a few. \n\n[[SHD Network]] is the agency's core technology. It links numerous dedicated assets directly controlled by the Division - drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), AWACS airplanes, and telecom satellites - and piggybacks their output onto existing civil, commercial, and military networking structures (cellphone towers, WiFi hotspots, NASA and GPS radionavigation satellites, and so on) to create a seamless global web of connectivity and data. \n\nThis redundancy ensures the SHD Network's reliability in case of catastrophic emergency. This reliability is crucial: the network connects agents in the field to Division HQ and to strategic government decision makers. \n\n== Technology Usage ==\nCommon examples of gadgetry employed by The Division and their agents are pod launchers, first aid tech, armor kits and retractable ballistic shields, turrets, seeker mines and portable stations employed in skills. Division operatives\u00a0possess [[Contact Lense|Contact Lenses]], that lets agents view their augmented reality heads-up display (AR HUD), which is synced to [[ISAC]], and\u00a0the agent's [[Smart Watch]], all Division agents also carry a\u00a0[[ISAC\u00a0Brick|ISAC Brick]] which\u00a0also allows\u00a0the agent to communicate with fellow agents, hack nearby communication systems and computers, scan their surroundings and objects and using nearby ISAC server nodes to process nearby surveillance cameras, satellite feeds and local evidence to produce an [[ECHO]] which allows a Division Agent to reconstruct an\u00a0event in near-real time.\n\nSHD Tech is also used to\u00a0reference more large-scale assets, like the SHD terminals employed in [[Last Stand (mode)|Last Stand]]\u00a0and SHD Nodes, large scale servers that are scattered across the cities of the United States and linked together by a military-grade satellite network.\u00a0SHD Nodes are vital part of SHD Tech as they provide the raw processing power and information that ISAC uses to deploy field equipment such as Turrets. The term \"[[Division Tech]]\" is typically used interchangeably with SHD Tech.\n\nAny active usage of SHD Tech in the field generally always means a Division agent is in the area, unless the tech was otherwise abandoned. SHD Tech has a unique signature identifiable by other instances of SHD Tech, meaning agents can always tell when SHD Technology is being used in some capacity by another agent or is otherwise present on the scene.\n\n\n== SHD Network Sabotages ==\nSHD Tech is susceptible to sabotage as shown\u00a0in [[Washington, D.C.]],\u00a0the [[Black Tusk]]\u00a0destroyed both the primary\u00a0SHD Node hidden in a decommissioned Cold War-era nuclear military bunker below the Washington Underground Gallery and multiple secondary nodes scattered across the city, including one\u00a0underground near the Lincoln Memorial\u00a0as shown in an [[ECHO]]. This created a catastrophic failure in the SHD Network, which as noted by Agent [[Alani Kelso]]\u00a0caused all SHD Tech in a 50-mile radius of D.C. to go offline, this also cut off all communication with Division Agents across the country.

However, whether the D.C. failure affected them on the same scale is uncertain.\n\nSHD Tech also been\u00a0seen being operated by enemy\u00a0factions like\u00a0the [[Last Man Battalion]] since their leader struck a mutual deal with\u00a0[[Aaron Keener]] and his fellow [[Rogue Division Agents]]. The LMB were given\u00a0access to the rogue agents' SHD Technologies in return for resources\u00a0and have learned to replicate some, such as Med-kits, Turrets, Seeker Mines and Support Stations.\n\nMeanwhile, rogue agents\u00a0in New York and Washington, D.C. have been shown to be able to keep control of their SHD Tech after going Rogue and being disavowed, by disabling their ISAC Brick, which causes\u00a0their SHD Tech to glow red instead of orange, this has since been used to identify a rogue agent in the Dark Zone.\n\nThe [[True Sons]], a jingoistic paramilitary organization faction in D.C.\u00a0also\u00a0managed to replicate some SHD Technologies due to the presence of Rogue Division Agents in their ranks because they chose to join [[Antwon Ridgeway|Colonel Ridgeway]]'s cause after the city's collapse. Examples of these technologies include Defibrillators, Deployable Turrets and Riot Foam.\n\nSome SHD technologies are even used by the [[Hunters]], the most, intimidating and most powerful faction the Division agents have ever faced. Examples of these SHD technologies used by the Hunters are Jammer Pulses, Medkits, Armor Kits, Seeker\u00a0Mines, Deployable Turrets. Hunters in particular have\u00a0shown they have the\u00a0ability to hack SHD gadgetry to use against the said gadget's original owners through unknown means.\n\n\n== List of known SHD Technologies ==\nHere is a list of known SHD Tech which are used by Division agents as skills; during their campaigns in [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]] and then later on in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n{{Skill}}\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nTom Clancy's The Division Smart Watch Art.jpg|The SHD Smart Watch.\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[Category:Currency]]\n[[Category:Gameplay]]\n[[Category:Equipment]]\n[[Category:SHD Tech]]\n[[Category:The Division]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]",

  "Status Effect": "{{Wpn-nav|the division=1|the division 2=1}}A '''Status Effect''' is a condition that affects an individual, whether a player or an NPC, that impacts their ability to perform actions. In common ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]'' parlance, this almost always refers to '''Debuffs''' that can temporarily cripple a character in one way or another. Player characters and NPCs may exhibit differing behavior when exposed to a status effect, but the net result should still be the same. Upon players, most status effects impact the user interface (UI) on top of any other mechanical effects. Using certain status effects (as well as suppressive fire) is what passes as \"crowd control\" in ''The Division''.\n\nStatus Effects are typically inflicted from [[Skills]], [[Grenades]] and consumables, environmental effects or from certain [[Weapons in Tom Clancy's The Division#Weapon Talents|Talents]] on [[Gear]]. They can be cleansed by the [[First Aid]] skill, the Immunizer mod on the [[Support Station]], the [[Recovery Link]] Signature Skill, certain [[High End Gear Talents|Gear Talents]], and eating the [[Energy Bar]] consumable. Certain stat rolls on gear can include resistances to specific effects (or resistance to all effects, in one case). The {{Exotic|Urban MDR|Urban MDR}}'s exclusive \"[[Distracted (Weapon Talent)|Distracted]]\" talent lets the weapon do increased damage against targets suffering from a status effect, making it a good weapon for those specializing in applying and maintaining status effects.\n\n== Types of Status Effects ==\n{{Status Effect}}\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n[[Category:Gameplay]]",
  "Survivalist (Specialization)": "[[File:Survivalist t.png|thumb|127x127px]]\n'''The Survivalist''' is a [[Specializations|Specialization]] that appears in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''. When agents have this specialization equipped, they have access to the [[Crossbow]] Signature Weapon, Incendiary Grenades, and the Mender Seeker Mine. They can upgrade their abilities and gain new abilities through their perk tree.\n\n== Unique Abilities ==\n\n=== Signature Weapon ===\nThe Signature Weapon for the Survivalist is the [[Crossbow]]. This Crossbow comes with bolts that have an explosive payload attached to them. When fired, the bolts can stick to a target and will explode after a short time has passed. This will deal explosive damage to the target and other enemies nearby. Like the other Signature Weapons, ammunition for this crossbow is rare, and thus should be used wisely. Killing enemies under status effects adds 3 to the ammo bar.\n\n=== Mender Seeker Mine ===\nThe Survivalist's unique skill is the [[Seeker Mine|Mender Seeker Mine]]. This variant of the Seeker Mine will heal friendlies instead of damaging foes. Once deployed, it will follow around the player who deployed it and heal them. It can also be assigned to follow another player or friendly entities. The Mender Seeker Mine is easily distinguished from its deadly counterparts as it has a green glow to it that is easily visible.\n\n=== Incendiary Grenade ===\nThe Survivalist also comes with the Incendiary Grenade. This grenade has a wider radius than the concussive grenade, but doesn't do immediate damage. Instead, anyone caught in the radius of the grenade is set on fire, slowly chipping away at their health, at the same time leaving them vulnerable as they try to pat the flames out.  \n\n== Perk Tree ==\nThe Survivalist comes with a unique perk tree that allows for upgrading the Division agent's abilities\n\n{{stub}}\n\n== Premium Content ==\nFor players with the Year 1 Season Pass, they will unlock the Survivalist Outfit.

This weapon can fire multiple tracking missiles to multiples targets at once. When aiming, the launcher will lock enemies, the launcher can lock multiple missiles on one target. This will deal explosive damage to the targets and other enemies nearby. Like the other Signature Weapons, ammunition for this launcher is rare, and thus should be used wisely. Destroying hostile skill proxies, drones, and robotics adds 3 to the ammo bar.\n\n=== Artificer Hive ===\nThe Technician's unique skill is the [[hive#Artificer|Artificer Hive]]. This variant of the Hive will boost nearby deployed skills. Once deployed, it will spend its charges to reload, heal and boost damage to nearby devices. It can also be used while not deployed, the hive will send boost only to the player's devices. The Artificer Hive is easily distinguished from its counterparts as it has a purple area of effect that is easily visible.\n\n=== EMP Grenade ===\nThe Technician also comes with the EMP Grenade. This grenade has a wider radius than the concussive grenade (5 meters).

This game also marks the debut of Massive and Ubisoft's Snowdrop game engine.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe player plays as an agent from the [[Strategic Homeland Division]] (SHD) using a third person cover-based system securing multiple locations in [[New York City]] through main missions with optional side missions. The player will have to scavenge for their own ammo and supplies in order to survive and upgrade their character. An online connection is required. Players can either choose to play on their own or join a squad of up to 4 players.\n\n\n=== Urban Jungle ===\nNew York City is being overrun by hostile groups trying to take advantage of the crisis. Beware of the [[Rioters]] who roam in packs through the city, preying on the weak. Fight against the [[Cleaners]], who wear hazmat suits and wield flamethrowers, set on cleaning New York from the virus by burning everything and everyone.

It's also the most dangerous area in the game, where fear, betrayal, and tension are high. Team up with other players to take down your enemies and extract legendary loot via helicopter.

The simulation spiraled out of control within a few days, and predicted a \"breakdown in essential institutions,\" civil disorder, and massive civilian casualties. This event came true years later in November 2015, when a virus was created that attached to bank notes (nicknamed the \"[[Green Poison|Dollar Flu]]\" due to its infection vector) circulated on Black Friday, causing, within a day, an\u00a0international pandemic. [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]], where the gameplay is set, is where the virus originated and the effects of the viral pandemic were the worst.\n\n\n== Locations ==\n{{main|Locations}}\n\nThere are multiple locations around [[New York City]] to explore.

Cosmetics have no effect on the players actual stats. Examples include outfits, skins etc.\n\nAdditionally, players are able to equip passive aesthetic accessories with no effect on armor rating, such as hats, scarfs, jackets, shirts, pants, and boots.\n\nPlayers start with a '''''{{Worn|Body Armor|Vest}}, {{Worn|Masks|Protective Mask}}, {{Worn|Knee Pads}}, {{Worn|Backpack}}, {{Worn|Gloves}}''', ''and a'' '''{{Worn|Holsters|Holster}}'''''.\n\n\n== Clothing ==\n{{Main|Clothing}}\n\nAgents will be able to customize many different aspects of their character in The Division.

Players can enter the Dark Zone through certain checkpoint gateways and by climbing over specific walls near the Dark Zone. The loot in the Dark Zone is some of the best acquirable in the game due to the fact that it is abandoned [[JTF]] (Joint Task Force) military gear. Players will lose any gear they pick up in the Dark Zone if they are killed while carrying the gear before extracting it via helicopter. The Dark Zone is designed to have up to 24 players in an instance at a time. (the player can go from the regular map to the Dark Zone with no instancing. It's located northwest of the player's Base of Operations.)\n\nPlayers have the task of taking back [[New York City]] through different methods.

Massive Entertainment is using the new Snowdrop engine to develop The Division.\n\nOn May 15, 2014, it was announced that\u00a0The Division\u00a0would be delayed to 2015 according to an anonymous source inside Massive Entertainment's\u00a0studio. \"The game engine works well, it's not done, but works well. The actual game development has barely started, however,\" said the anonymous insider.\n\nIn 2015, a Ubisoft conference call confirmed that The Division was slated for a 2015 release, but it was delayed yet again.\n\nAt E3 2015, it was stated that beta testing for Xbox One players would begin in December. A closed Alpha Test took place from December 9, 2015 to December 12, 2015. This was exclusively for the Xbox One console. The Closed Beta test took place January 28, 2016 through February 1, 2016 for Xbox One, PS4, and PC.\n\nThe release date for ''Tom Clancy's The Division'' was March 8, 2016.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Main|Tom Clancy's The Division (Original Game Soundtrack)}}\n\nThe soundtrack is composed by Ola Strandh.

[[Aaron Keener]] - one of The Division's original antagonists, as well as the first Division Agent to go rogue - has brought the factions of [[New York City]] under his control, and used them to conquer Lower Manhattan.\n\nWith other rogue Agents and a lethal new viral strain at his command, Keener is poised to eradicate what little has been rebuilt since the catastrophic Black Friday pandemic. The battle to restore order continues, but now The Division has a new mission: Stop Keener at any cost.|Description}}\n\n'''Warlords of New York''' is a paid content expansion added to [[ Tom Clancy's The Division 2|''Tom Clancy's'' ''The Division 2'']]'','' that was released on March 3, 2020.\n\n== Summary ==\n[[Aaron Keener]], a former [[Rogue Division Agents|First Wave Division Agent]] who went [[Rogue Status|rogue]] during the collapse of [[New York City|New York]] has reappeared after 6 months since he went off the grid. He now has developed his own biological weapons with the help of [[Gordon Amherst|Dr. Amherst's]] notes on the Green Poison and also with the help of [[Vitaly Tchernenko]], a Russian Virologist he kidnapped during the events of ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]. ''\n\nHe uses these weapons to attack The Division [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]] in New York City killing top Division agents and Analysts. After that, he took control of Lower Manhattan and is backed by four devoted and highly skilled former First Wave Division agents [[Vivian \"Uranus\" Conley|Vivian Conley]], [[Javier Kajika]], [[James Dragov]] and [[Theo Parnell]].\n\nDivision agents from Washington, D.C. are called in for backup along with [[Alani Kelso]] and must now work with acting Division Commander [[Faye Lau]] and former Division ally [[Paul Rhodes]] to regain control of Lower Manhattan.\n\n==Characters==\n*[[Aaron Keener]]\n*[[Vivian \"Uranus\" Conley|Vivian Conley]]\n*[[Javier Kajika]]\n*[[James Dragov]]\n*[[Theo Parnell]]\n*[[Alani Kelso]]\n*[[Paul Rhodes]]\n*[[Roy Benitez]]\n*[[Faye Lau]]\n\n== Activities ==\n\n=== Investigations ===\nDivision agents must complete several investigations into Aaron Keener's four rogue lieutenants.\n* [[Javier Kajika Investigation]]\n* [[Vivian Conley Investigation]]\n* [[James Dragov Investigation]]\n* [[Theo Parnell Investigation]]\n\n=== Missions ===\n* [[Stranded Tanker]]\n* [[Wall Street (Mission)|Wall Street]]\n* [[Pathway Park]]\n* [[Liberty Island]]\n* [[The Tombs]]\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter receiving a distress call from New York City, the player and Kelso head out to answer the call. While requesting permission to land, Faye Lau suddenly goes radio silent. The player and Kelso then jump out of the copter carrying them once it is close to the ground, albeit under enemy fire. The agents then proceed to investigate the City Hall, discovering once they get inside that the persons responsible for the attack are Keener and his four lieutenants.\n\nThe agents then head to Haven, a settlement started by Paul Rhodes, and are initially denied entry by the [[Peacekeepers]], the spiritual successor to the JTF, as they are less friendly and more doubting of The Division. However, Rhodes, after some persuading from Lau and Roy Benitez, tells the Peacekeepers to allow them in.\n\nOnce the player arrives inside Rhodes office, Rhodes is pressured by Lau and Benitez to allow the Division agents to use Haven as a safe house. Rhodes is initially hesitant to allow The Division to stay, citing the situation in Hell's Kitchen from [[Tom Clancy's The Division|the first Division game.]] After Lau and Benitez convince Rhodes that both his and The Division's goals are similar, he begrudgingly allows The Division to stay, on the condition that once Keener was eliminated, The Division and Benitez were to leave Haven immediately.\n\nThe player is briefed on the situation in light of the attack on City Hall that they helped end. Keener's whereabouts are unknown at the time, so instead the team decides to hunt down Keener's four lieutenants: Vivian Conley, Theo Parnell, James Dragov and Javier Kajika. The player is free to choose the order in which they hunt down the targets. Each target involves 3 or 4 steps to locate and eliminate, with some lieutenants having missions even after their demise to find out the grander scheme of their assistance to Keener.\n\nWith the elimination of Kajika, Lau tells the player that she will move in and secure his hideout while also securing the information he possessed, hoping it would lead them closer to Keener.\n\nThe elimination of Dragov saw the end of Keener's supply line to help move the materials for his project (which he reveals at the end of the campaign). Lau states that she and a team will secure those supplies, but also states she is unsure how many supplies still made it to Keener before Dragov's demise.\n\nConley's death weakens the Cleaner faction as their leader was killed again, like [[Joe Ferro]] was in the prior Division game. Lau states she will send in a team to recover the oil on the stranded tanker, as well as any info left behind, stating that \"the JTF will be able to keep the generators on this winter\" with the oil they will recover.\n\nParnell, being the tech specialist of the group, was essential in many projects Keener had going and/or was planning. His death essentially halted any projects that weren't already finished. Lau states in the debriefing that they will use his watch to try to track Keener, but that it will take some time.\n\nIn-game, the player will then need to meet 2 requirements before being allowed to access the Liberty Island mission and take on Keener; the player must be level 40, and the player must complete the [[Castle Clinton |Castle Clinton side mission]]. Once both are satisfied, the player then receives a message from Kelso that they are ready to move in on Liberty Island, where Keener is holding out on, and end this, once and for all.\n\nDuring the course of the Liberty Island mission, the player runs into Black Tusk, who are destroying ferries headed for Liberty Island from the ferry terminal. The player stops the Black Tusk from destroying the last ferry, and both the player and Kelso set sail for Liberty Island.\n\nKeener, however, had set up a surveillance system, which alerts him that there is a ferry approaching. While the ferry approaches, a Black Tusk hovercraft moves in and bombards the ferry with a missile barrage. The player and Kelso survive the bombardment and reach the island. As the player slowly recovers from the blast, Kelso tells the player to go on ahead as she takes her time to recover. Keener then hacks into the comms network of the agents, teasing them about making it. Kelso then goes radio silent to avoid alerting Keener to their plans. The player then fights past Black Tusk forces, including a [[DDP-52 Razorback]], before being intercepted by a [[XB-31 \"Marauder\"|Marauder]] class Quadcopter (the last one the Black Tusk has at its disposal) and a platoon of heavy units.\n\nHowever, Keener hacks into the quadcopter and eliminates the platoon, then setting the copter's sights on the player. While the player fights the copter, Keener also hacks some [[Warhound|Warhounds]] and attacks the player with those as well. After the player eliminates the Warhounds and quadcopter, the Black Tusk leader, [[Bardon Schaeffer|Bardon Schaeffer,]] is left with no more assets to invade the island, and orders a retreat from the island, leaving the player to deal with Keener.\n\nAfter the player investigates a series of ECHOs in which Keener taunts the player about his resources and legacy, the player finds themselves in a room with Keener's laptop. Upon trying to access it, Keener activates several SHD Tech boxes that spawn in rogue SHD abilities, similar to the ones the player has. The player must then survive while being attacked by what is essentially The Division's own weapons, including Stinger HIVEs and flamethrowing turrets. ISAC also is tampered with during this fight, with objectives such as \"KILL Paul RHODES\" and \"GIVE UP!\" appearing on screen. After a while, ISAC recovers from its tampering and the player must then secure the area as no more SHD Tech is spawned.\n\nPlayers then make their way outside, to the base of the Statue of Liberty, where Keener has set up a missile with a payload of his weaponized virus, developed by [[Vitaly Tchernenko]] while Keener held him captive. He named this payload [[Eclipse Virus|Project Eclipse]]. The player is then tasked with stopping the launch of the missile, which involves capturing the 3 generators of the missile launcher, one at a time, and destroying the weak points that are exposed, followed by destroying the last weak point. During this time, rogue SHD Tech similar to the ones deployed in the previous encounter spawn in and try to stop the player.\n\nOnce the player destroys the last weak point, the rogue SHD Tech self-destructs as Keener proceeds to insult the player about being a \"brainwashed puppet\" for destroying Keener's project, after which he comes down and challenges the player. After a fight in which Keener disables the players' abilities, as well as deploys more rogue SHD Tech, Keener is severely wounded and manages to escape to the docks by shocking the player in place.\n\nOnce on the docks, however, Keener only makes it as far as about halfway down the docks, before needing to sit down due to his wounds. The player catches up to him, aiming their pistol at him whilst approaching slowly. Keener attempts to reach for his sidearm, but the player kicks it away before he does. Agent Kelso then appears, telling Keener it's over. However, as a last act of defiance, Keener activates his watch. The player and Kelso notice this, with Kelso interrogating Keener while the player takes his watch off quickly. Keener, in his last breaths, tells Kelso and the player that they have no idea what's coming, before succumbing to his wounds. \n\nKelso then signals for a helicopter from the dock. Keener's watch then activates and proceeds to play a conversation between Agent Faye Lau and Schaeffer. Agent Lau is revealed to have gone rogue and is now in league with the Black Tusk.\n\nOnce the player and Kelso return to Haven and reveal Lau's rogue status to Benitez and Rhodes, Rhodes reveals that he never trusted Lau, but he now trusts the player, as they have taken down Keener and made Haven safe again. Benitez then states that a pilot is now available to take the player back to D.C., but they are still welcome to stay in New York as there is more to be done, and they are safer when the player is in New York.\n\nWith the activation of the Rogue Network, things are getting more complicated as rogue agents answer the call and retaliate.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nWarlords of New York.jpg\nWarlords of New York Keener Poster.jpg| Aaron Keener\nWarlords of New York Cleaners Faction.jpg|The Cleaners\nWarlords of New York Keener Rogue Agents.jpg|Keener's Rogue Agents - Left to Right - James Dragov, Theo Parnell, Aaron Keener, Vivian Conley, Javier Kajika\nWarlords of New York Rikers Faction.jpg|Rikers\nWarlords of New York Screenshot 01.png\nWarlords of New York Screenshot 02.png\nWarlords of New York Screenshot 03.png\nWarlords of New York Screenshot 04.png\nWarlords of New York Screenshot 05.png\nWarlords of New York Screenshot 06.png\nDivision2.WarlordsodNewYork.Header.png\nApps.41059.13786358111950101.0b095a53-01c5-4fcd-b970-c2d2cab63222.jpg|Keener and his Warlords\nApps.38551.14542276780983031.88c53311-8fba-4cb5-a31e-ac4aa45fc1f3.jpg\nDivision agents Cleaner.jpg|Division agents in a gun battle with a Cleaner\n3636389-tactical-response.jpg|Pre-order bonuses for Warlords of New York\n3636391-tct2-wony ultimate en.jpg\nDivision-2-warlords-new-york.png|Again, Keener is seen here with his Warlords\n3635691-d2-wony.png\nFile:6 960x540.jpg\nFile:Fs8kMQnXwAAKRWT.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* During the Warlords of New York campaign, [[Black Tusk]] are recruiting the remnants of the [[Last Man Battalion]] into their force.\n[[ru:\u0412\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u041d\u044c\u044e-\u0419\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0430]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Expansions]]\n[[Category:Patches and Updates]]\n[[Category:Downloadable Content in The Division 2]]",

However, if Mobile Cover doesn't have any other use, [[Sticky Bomb]] or [[Seeker Mine]] are better picks.\n*In P-V-E, Mobile Cover with Extension and Turret with Zapper are a good combo. Extension can \"protect\" the fragile Zapper by increasing player Threat, allowing it to slow down hostiles from somewhere else.\n*Blast cover inflicts Blind/Deaf along with the damage. This can be used as a replacement for Flashbang Sticky Bomb, due to its higher damage and lower cooldown, despite having smaller radius.\n\n\n== Gallery==\n<gallery>\nMobile Cover1.png|Base Mod Mobile Cover\nMobile Cover Extension Mod.png|Extension Mod Mobile Cover\nMobile Cover Blast Cover.png|Blast Cover Mod<br/>(Note the small explosive devices attached to the cover)\nMobile Cover Countermeasures.png|Countermeasures Mod<br/>(Note the antennas on top of the cover)\nMobile Cover bag.png|Mobile Cover attachment to the backpack when the skill is equipped\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n{{Weapon SHD Tech}}\n[[Category:Skills]]\n[[Category:Abilities]]\n[[Category:The Division]]\n[[Category:SHD Tech]]",
  "Patches and Updates/Update 1.8: Resistance": "'''[[File:1.8_Patch_Notes.png|thumb|400px]]Update 1.8: Resistance '''is an update to ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''. Update 1.8 was revealed on August 30, 2017, and was deployed on December 5, 2017. This free update brings an expansion to the PVE zone, new game modes, as well as changes to the Rogue System in the Dark Zone.\n==New Features==\n===West Side Pier===\n*West Side Pier is a completely new area accessible for all agents where two new game modes take place: \u2018Resistance\u2019 and \u2018Skirmish\u2019. In the zones, the enemy factions are teaming up to take the fight to the Division agents.\n*The West Side Pier map stretches over two named zones: Piers North and Piers South.\n*A new safe house will be available named Camp Clinton. Camp Clinton will act as a new social hub, similar to the Terminal, for Update 1.8.\n*West Side Pier features a new dynamic spawning system for enemies, new special assignments, and daily assignments.\n*West Side Pier Commendations have been added.\n===Skirmish===\n*In Skirmish, two teams of four agents compete against each other to get the highest number of kills before the timer expires. Teams earn points each time a downed enemy agent is eliminated.\n*Agents can start a Skirmish session from the Last Stand matchmaking gate in the Base of Operations or Camp Clinton.\n*PvP rank (previously called Last Stand rank) cap has been increased from 40 to 99. Last Stand and Skirmish both contribute to this progression.\n*New PvP rank rewards have been added, including Classified Caches.\n*Skirmish Commendations have been added.\n===Rogue 2.0===\n*The Rogue system in the Dark Zone has been overhauled for Update 1.8.\n*To go Rogue, the agent needs to toggle their Rogue status before being able to do any damage to friendly agents. Any member of their group can choose to also go Rogue or to leave the group.\n*Manhunt levels and objectives have been added. Agents reaching Manhunt status will now have an objective to interact with, which will reward Manhunt Caches. Non-Rogue agents will see the general area of the Manhunt objective and will be rewarded for stopping the Manhunt agents.\n*To go Rogue, hold Up on the Directional Pad.\n===Optimization Station===\n*Gear Optimization provides an all new way for agents to invest in their favorite gear and achieve the perfect min-maxed build for their playstyle. Agents can take any of their gear to the new Gear Optimization station and spend Division Tech and Credits to improve the quality of the item\u2019s stats towards their cap.\n===Resistance===\n*The update introduces a new PvE game mode called \u2018Resistance\u2019 where factions are teaming up for the first time to fight against Division agents. Enemy NPCs continuously spawn in waves as the agents try to survive for as long as they can.\n*This new PvE game mode takes place in three arenas in West Side Pier.\n*Agents can start an event from the map or by walking to the arena locations located in West Side Pier and initializing the event from there.\n*Resistance Commendations have been added.\n===Underground changes===\n*The old Directives have been removed and replaced by new ones that bring new gameplay options.\n**Electro Tech\u00a0\u2013 New electro-tech gives the player vastly reduced cool-down on skills, however a side effect of this experimental technology causes disruption to other electrical systems while a skill is activate.\n**Adrenal Healing\u00a0\u2013Agents are granted a constant adrenaline boost, restoring their health, however the extra intake means less frequent use is available for all healing abilities.\n**Kinetic Armor\u00a0\u2013 Experimental new gear that increases Agents armor as they increase their movement speed. Armor protection is significantly reduced when static.\n**Compensator\u00a0\u2013 Experimental tech that gives all weapons extra stability when firing down the sights; however due to weight of this tech Agents have decreased ammo capacity.\n**Shock Ammo\u00a0- Specially designed magazines allow for permanent shock bullets, but with constant fire this can cause it to be unusable for a short time and potentially shock the Agent.\n*The Underground will now have checkpoints.\n*Hunters have been added to the Underground as a random spawn. When they show up, there will always be one more Hunter than there are agents present. Slain Hunters have a chance of dropping Exotics and Classified Gear Sets.\n*The Rave Room from the End is NY mission has been added to the room rotation.\n*New Directives panel added to the Tactical Operations Center.\n*New quick launch options in the Tactical Operations Center for Daily and 3 Phase 5 Directive Operations.\n*Underground Daily Operations and Weekly Assignment information added to the map.\n*The Underground has been given weekly assignments, and will reward a Weekly Cache which contains an Exotic.\n*Rewards have been increased overall in the Underground.\n*New Underground Commendations have been added.\n*New Patches have been added as commendation rewards.\n*Added ability to fast travel to Daily Operations.\n*Players are now able to match-make for customized operations and for daily operations.\n\n==New Classified Gear==\n<p style=\"outline:none0px;box-sizing:border-box;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:1.25rem;font-family:Borda-Regular,Borda-Demi-Bold,Arial;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6;text-rendering:optimizeLegibility;color:rgb(255,255,255);\">The new Classified Gear Sets which will become available in upcoming Global Events are:</p>\n\n\n*Global Event 3 \u2018Strike\u2019:\n**Path of the Nomad\n**D3-FNC\n**Predator\u2019s Mark\n**Banshee\u2019s Shadow\n*Global Event 4 \u2018Ambush\u2019:\n**AlphaBridge\n**FireCrest\n**Hunter\u2019s Faith\n**Tactician\u2019s Authority.\n\n===AlphaBridge===\n*Set Bonus (5 pieces):\n**+25% Health Regen\n**+10% Weapon Damage\n*Set Bonus (6 pieces):\n**Talent: Improved AlphaBridge\n***Inactive personal versions of all Signature Skills are rotating every 6 seconds and can be activated by killing enemy agents or Veteran/Elite NPCs.

Once in proximity, the mine will immediately detonate in an explosion for damage or another effect. The Seeker Mine has a few settings that the user can program into the Seeker Mine to create a variety of effects. \n\nRequirement: [[Tech Wing]] Upgrade - [[Communications]].\n\n==Base values for the Seeker Mine at Level 30==\n{{Seeker Mine}}\n\n\n==Tips==\n*The Seeker Mine is one of the few [[skills]] where it's functionally drastically changes across all four versions. The mods focus on Crowd Control in different forms and applying different levels of damage, so if you're looking for a single powerful explosive burst of damage, the base skill is worth considering.\n*The Seeker Mine, while not as lethal or loud like the [[Sticky Bomb]], makes up for these shortcomings by being hard to dodge once it's deployed and fulfilling different niches.\n*Just as the Sticky Bomb can supplement your supply of [[Grenades]], the Seeker Mine is a good alternative if you're looking for ordnance to deal damage or apply crowd control with. Specifically, the mine serves as an [[Grenades|Incendiary Grenade]] (Air-burst), [[Grenades|Tear Gas Grenade]] (Gas Charge) or miniature [[Grenades|Fragmentation Grenade]] (Baseline/Cluster) on a stick.\n*Air-burst and Gas Charge are both effective at crowd control, though the Gas Charge sacrifices lethality in exchange for being able to disorient the enemy.\n*The Seeker Mine, like any other deployable skill, can be destroyed before releasing its payload by shooting at it. The mine will not move until a target is within range, and a target can usually tell when a mine is locked onto them and in close proximity.\n*The Cluster Seeker Mine has its uses in Player vs. Player (P-v-P) action as well, since four smaller mines are more difficult to destroy than one big mine, and applying the [[Status Effect|Bleed Effect]] makes the enemy slightly easier to control. However, since destroying deployable can contribute towards certain build effects (destroying a deployable count as a \"kill\"), and since the Seeker Mine technically counts as a deployable, destroying the four miniature mines from the Cluster counts as four kills for build purposes, and that could mean trouble.\n*Air-burst is effective against single, powerful enemies, since the [[Status Effect|Burn Effect]] deals damage over time and leaves the enemy incapacitated as they try to put out the flames.\n*[[Turret]]s will target seeker mines and usually destroy them as fast as they're deployed, so it is wise to either destroy the turret first or throw the mines out of its field of view.\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nSeeker Mine TD.png|Seeker Mine\nAirburst Mine.png|Airburst Seeker Mine\nGas Charge Mine.png|Gas Charge Seeker Mine\nCluster Mine.png|Cluster Seeker Mine\nSeeker Mine bag.png|The bag of Seeker Mines attached to the backpack when the Skill is equipped.\nSeeker_mine.png|An agent deploying a Seeker Mine.\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n{{Weapon SHD Tech}}\n[[Category:Skills]]\n[[Category:Abilities]]\n[[Category:SHD Tech]]\n[[Category:The Division]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]",

  "ANNA": "{{Quote|Greetings, rogues. Are we ready to cause some trouble?|ANNA}}\n{{Gadgets\n|name  = <center>Advanced Neural Network Algorithm</center>\n|image = [[ANNA.png]]\n|type  = [[SHD Tech]]\n|role  = Communication Device\n|users = [[Rogue Division Agents]] \n[[Hunters]]}}\n'''A.N.N.A.''' (<u>'''A'''dvanced '''N'''eural '''N'''etwork '''A'''lgorithm</u>) is a highly advanced artificial intelligence (AI) entity available to all active [[Rogue Division Agents]] equipped with an [[SHD Tech]] transceiver. Accessible via the [[SHD Network]], ANNA serves as the critical backbone of all backdoor Division activities.\n\nANNA's assimilative intelligence provides key field-operation services to every rogue agent including but not limited to communications, real-time analytics, remote data collection and retrieval, weather telemetry, and inter-action with assorted other technologies. It can even go as far as creating sarcastic comments/jokes. It communicates to Rogue Division Agents through a computerized voice with short, clipped phrases. When not speaking with other characters, ANNA is an agent's go-to source for information at any time. Its main function is to keep the communications of all Rogues Agents and possible [[Hunters]], safe and secure.\n\nANNA can sort and analyze field sensor information to provide tactical support; relay alerts and updates; identify human targets or contacts via biometric markers; and set waypoints to strategic objectives.\n\n[[Alexander Ortiz]] and [[Claire Ortiz]] form [[Ortiz Robotics]] are the ones who created ANNA, [[Aaron Keener]] repurposed ANNA as a backdoor system of [[ISAC]], it's noted that ANNA is able to pass the Turing test and gives more in-depth details to the user of how one could get a job done unlike ISAC.\n\n\n==History ==\nANNA was first pitched by [[Claire Ortiz]] to her husband, [[Alexander Ortiz|Alexander]], as an AI that's completely automated and has no need for intel analysts to sift through data in addition to using biometrics and voice recognition to detect legitimate threats.\n\nIt wouldn't take long for the first prototype of ANNA to be developed, which Alexander was pleased enough that he believes it would make them rich. However, ANNA's personality brought some concern to Alex, worrying that people would grow to hate her, while Claire noted that an AI would help agents feel less alone in the field. Before they can pitch the AI to prospective benefactors, Claire asked [[Vivian Conley]] (who was working with their company under a contract) to do an unauthorized field test to make sure the AI works.\n\nWhen [[Ortiz Robotics]] presented ANNA to [[Calvin McManus]]/[[Natalya Sokolova]], they were not interested. For example, Nat found the AI off-putting and insulting, as she wanted guidance systems for her [[Black Tusk|B.T.S.U.]] [[Warhound|Warhounds]], not a talking AI. As a result, two AI off-shoots were made: [[ISAC]] and [[DIAMOND]]. Furthermore, operators who volunteered for the field tests for the combat simulation program shared negative feedback on ANNA, which Claire found it to be disgusting as the negative feedback was majorly over the fact that operators had trouble listening to an AI handler with a female voice telling them what to do.\n\nOrders came up from the top to have ANNA shut down as ISAC was chosen as the AI system for [[Strategic Homeland Division]] Agents. Vivian Conley found out and was enraged, begging Claire to not let them \"kill\" ANNA, as she saw ISAC as inferior compared to the AI. Claire assured Conley that ANNA is kept safe beneath ISAC's code and within the [[Mobile SHD Server]].\n\n\n=== Finding ANNA ===\nAfter the [[Green Poison]] outbreak and the activation of the Division's First Wave/Second Wave, [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue]] agent Vivian Conley shared her past association with Ortiz Robotics, ANNA, the combat simulation program, and [[DARPA]] Engineer [[Mathias \"Trig\" Schneider]] with her fellow Rogues; [[Aaron Keener]] and [[Theo Parnell]]. Out of interest, Parnell called Trig and discussed about ANNA and her advanced programming. Trig felt the AI was truly autonomous, though given she was created by Claire Ortiz, he felt that the AI is a little wicked and doesn't care for the consequences to the powers that be, which makes it seem ANNA is truly dangerous if she decides someone is expendable.\n\nNevertheless, Theo likened ANNA to a goddess that demands respect, and Trig further supports the notion that as long as someone respects ANNA, she'll do anything to save them.\n\nAt some point, Keener and his rogues managed to procure a copy of ANNA and used her not just as the backdoor for all Division activities through ISAC, but as the foundation to build the [[Rogue Network]].\n\n\n=== Discovering ANNA ===\nStrategic Homeland Division agents wouldn't discover ANNA until they assaulted [[Liberty Island]] to neutralize Aaron Keener. During the assault, they heard the AI talking while they were dealing with an abundance of automated [[SHD Tech|SHD Skills]] underneath the Statue of Liberty in addition. When Keener was \"neutralized\", Keener's watch was taken as it housed ANNA inside. Though she rarely talked much.\n\n\n=== SHD and ANNA ===\nAfter Keener's supposed return from the dead, ANNA would work with SHD Agents in their journey to complete the rogue agent's trials. During the [[First Rogue|Nyx]] trial, ANNA cut off comms access to Keener and [[Manny Ortega]]. This surprised Manny, with Keener helping him understand ANNA's advancement and arguing that she took initiative when they were interrupting the agents during the trial. Moreover, Keener assured Manny that ANNA would re-instate their comms access once.\n\nAfter securing partnership with Keener and helping him secure a briefcase that contained six watched that houses ANNA in [[Federal Emergency Bunker: Aaron Keener|Federal Emergency Bunker]], the agents work more closely with ANNA in securing the other two member of Keener's team: Theo Parnell and Alani Kelso, giving her own input in the debreifings while the agents followed their trail.\n\nAdditionally, she gives priority objectives for agents to complete when necessary, be it in D.C. and beyond.\n\n=== Glasses and Cassandra ===\nDuring the Division's rescue of Theo Parnell in the NOA HQ Building from the Hyenas, ANNA helped the agents in unlocking doors and assisted them in eliminating the Hyena boss \"Bichon\", by using his armor's self-defense tech against him.\n\nLater on, the Division went through Kelso's trails to find clues and collect intel drops the Agent had left behind. When the trail takes the agents to Roosevelt Island, ANNA informs them of Faye Lau's Mobile SHD Server that True Sons forces were after. Across the way, ANNA informs the agents of Lau's laptop and the smart-watch from President Andrew Ellis for them to collect. After the True Sons were dealt with and Lau's server secure, the agents plays the ECHO where ANNA had text-to-speech added due to a missing audio file within the ECHO, where they learn the truth; President Ellis intentionally gave his security clearance of The Ark to Faye Lau and had her wipe the credentials on his end, so Natalya Sokolova couldn't have it. With that done, Ellis allowed Lau to kill him, so she could finish her mission.\n== Personality ==\nCompared to [[ISAC]], ANNA has a much more sophisticated personality as she's considered a truly autonomous AI who can display sarcasm and bluntness towards people she talks with. Not only that, she can pass the turing test and is able to give more in-depth details to a user on how to get the job done compared to ISAC, who only gives details in binary. Because she was created by [[Claire Ortiz]], ANNA has a tendency to be wicked, which would make her a liability to powerful people.\n\nIndeed, when [[Natalya Sokolova]] was presented with ANNA, she was put-off and insulted when the AI got sarcastic. And despite Claire insisting that ANNA is funny, her husband [[Alexander Ortiz|Alexander]] was apprehensive as he felt an AI like ANNA getting snarky with rich woman with plenty of money to invest in their projects is a bad idea. Over time, many operatives who field-tested with ANNA were hostile towards the AI, which Claire found disgusting and sexist cuz she saw the operatives not liking the AI because she happens to have a female voice telling them what to do. \n\nANNA seems to have a fondness for [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Division]] agents, especially [[Aaron Keener]], as she was glad he was back after faking his death.

By the end of the game, she states that she was able to come up with a cure, and that it was \"sent to people to create who are more able than her\". Before leaving to return to work, she warns that agent that if [[Eclipse Virus|this happens again]] they probably won't be able to stop it.\n\nSeven months following the initial Green Poison outbreak, Dr. Kandel had by then left New York and began working on a cure alongside other virologists at Ann Arbor Medical School.

In June 2000, Massive released the award-winning PC action-strategy title\u00a0''Ground Control'', published by\u00a0Sierra Studios. The same year an expansion was released named\u00a0''Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy''.\n\nin October 2007, they released the game\u00a0''World in Conflict'', which has been described in interviews on the company's official website as a further development of the\u00a0real-time tactics gameplay\u00a0formula from the\u00a0''Ground Control''\u00a0games, but set on Earth during an alternate history late\u00a0Cold War. The game was released on September 18, 2007, and won wide critical acclaim, including several nominations for one of the best games of 2007. It was followed by an expansion,\u00a0''World in Conflict: Soviet Assault''\u00a0in March 2009.\n\nOn August 6, 2008, Activision Blizzard put up Massive Entertainment for sale after the merger of Activision and Vivendi Games and the subsequent internal reorganization. On\u00a0 November 10, 2008, Ubisoft acquired Massive Entertainment. In March 2009, following the acquisition, the former CEO Martin Walfisz left Massive.\n\nIn December 2010, Ubisoft confirmed that Massive would be \"teaming up on a project for Assassin's Creed\". On May 5, 2011, it was announced that Massive Entertainment is collaborating on development of ''Assassin's Creed Revelations'', developing the Desmond's journey sequences in the game, which was released in November 2011. Massive also collaborated on the development of ''Far Cry 3'', which was released in December 2012.\n\nAt E3 2013 Massive announced and demonstrated their next game, ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''. The game was released in March 8, 2016, and sold more copies in its first 24 hours than any game in Ubisoft's history and that it had the biggest first week ever for a new game franchise, generating $330 million in its first five days.\n\nIn March 2017, Massive announced that their next major title will be based on\u00a0James Cameron's ''Avatar''.\n\nIn January 2021, the newly reformed Lucasfilm Games announced that Massive started work on a new ''Star Wars'' open world title. This would be the first ''Star Wars'' game outside of Electronic Arts since they acquired a May 2013 contract to produce all ''Star Wars'' related titles. This would later be revealed as ''Star Wars Outlaws,'' and it is scheduled to release in 2024.\n\nThe studio is much well known for developing games like:\n\n*''Ground Control''\n\n*''Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy''\n\n* ''Ground Control II: Operation Exodus''\n\n*''World in Conflict: Soviet Assault''\n\n*''Assassin's Creed Revelations''\u00a0(assisted\u00a0Ubisoft Montreal)\n\n*''Far Cry 3 ''(assisted\u00a0Ubisoft Montreal)\n\n*''Just Dance Now''\n\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n\n*''Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora''\n\n*''Star Wars Outlaws''\n\n[[Category:Developers]]",

Although he wasn't confronted directly by Division agents, he was directly involved in the events that unraveled in Brooklyn, as he was enlisted by Black Tusk officer, [[Richard Danvers]], to use his studio to create deep-fake videos as well as broadcasting propaganda to spread misinformation about [[Aaron Keener]] and [[The Bridge]] settlement.\n\n== History ==\nNot much is known about Matthew Grant prior to the outbreak, aside from the fact that he worked as an SFX Artist. Ten years prior to the outbreak, he was involved in creating special effects for a commercial that Natalya Sokolova starred in. Though Grant had joined in with the Cleaners during the Green Poison crisis, his SFX skills made an impression on Sokolova.\n\nIndeed, Grant was contacted by Black Tusk officer, Richard Danvers, where he'd be recruited for his talent. With his SFX studio at Dumbo Skate Park intact and with tech loaned from the Descent simulation program, Grant created deep-fake videos of Aaron Keener as a megalomaniacal psychopath as part of a psy-op to make people believe that Keener and The Bridge settlement are the bad guys.\n\n=== Battle for Brooklyn ===\nThough Division agents didn't confront Grant throughout their campaign against Richard Danvers, he was liable to the events unfolding there. He was helped Sarah Moretti in faking her death using the Descent sim's tech, making the Bridge's inhabitants believe she died at the Hudson River. \n\nGrant's voice can also be heard in the Cleaners Propaganda Broadcasts in Brooklyn. In these broadcasts, he explains the Cleaners' actions, justifying they're making the hard choices in burning out the infection. Moreover, the broadcasts also have him claim that The Bridge is developing a bioweapon, and claim it's imperative to destroy the settlement.\n\nGrant was stationed at The Army Terminal, while Black Tusk was getting ready to set their Zeppelin against the Bridge. When the Division attacked the compound, he was extracted via a helicopter alongside the scientists working there. While he luckily avoided the agents' wrath, the same couldn't be said for Richard Danvers.\n\nAnd with the Cleaners' operations in Brooklyn majorly disrupted and Danvers dead, Matthew Grant is set to be the next leader for the faction.

After passing her training, she was activated as one of the First Wave of Division agents to deal with the Dollar Flu threat. \n\nMelanie was initially partnered with a Division agent named Anderson, who she trained with, but he was soon killed by [[Cleaners]] after discovering that the quarantined apartment building where his family lived had been \"cleansed.\" Melanie soon discovered that her sister was one of the killers and actively carrying out attacks against survivors as well as medical staff. After recovering from a gunshot wound, she partners with Agent Hsu to continue her mission. Torn between duty and love of her family, she initially tries to take Johanna prisoner but is tricked before being disabled. This results in Hsu's death.\n\nEventually tracking down her sister, she is forced to kill her in order to stop a train full of bombs from destroying a refugee camp. While traumatized, she is reassured by her fellow Division agents that she did the right thing and has a Christmas phone call with her husband and son (who both escaped the city). Partnering with a new Division agent, her fate is unknown.\n\n== A New Assignment ==\nAt some point, Hoskins got into contact with Rogue Agent [[Aaron Keener]]. He started goading her by first talking about her sister, then the conversation changes when Keener asks her about her loyalties to [[Calvin McManus]]. In an attempt to convince her, he pulled an audio recording from ISAC, revealing Cal's negligence over [[Gordon Amherst]].\n\nAfter being shown the truth, Hoskins was convinced for the time being, though she still didn't trust Keener and had some reluctance defecting from the Division. As a show of goodwill, Keener used his Rogue Network to allow Melanie to leave the Manhattan Island and see her family in Buffalo, Colorado. He promised to send some of his people to her family to keep them safe, just in case. And in exchange, Melanie is tasked to visit an installation nestled in a small town in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAfter visiting her family and checking up on them alive and stable, Hoskins gives a status report to Keener, revealing that the farm that her aunt got was bought using her Division bonus as a backup plan. In any case, Hoskins goes on the road, stopping in Chicago for a bit. She reported the state of things there to Keener, even adding supply trucks coming in and out of the city are commandeered by people who are not CERA, describing their apparel as biker gear. She reaches the small town, finding it to be a warzone. She's puzzled at the lack of Division operations there, but Keener reminded her to focus on her mission: Intercepting Cal's Hunter, He warned her to stay alert and expect contact once she gets close to the installation. \n\nHoskins does make it inside the base and entered the secret entrance via a SHD Tech explosive, finding no opposition and managed to procure a USB drive a containing a roster as well as finding a team of four dead agents. She contacts Keener, revealing what she found. She also mentions that ISAC made a sweep of the deceased agents and their status reports, revealing that they were infected by Green Poison. However, the way those agents died wasn't by the poison itself. And apparently, that team were in a local lab to work on the antivirals for DCD before they all scattered and died. \n\nHoskins took side roads to leave [Redacted] in order to avoid the Hunters who were sent there by McManus. \n\n== Revelations and a Special Assignment ==\nAfter returning to keener, it is revealed that the flash drive that Hoskins recovered contains a list of people who were recruited into the Hunter program before the Division's activation. While Keener was frustrated given the Division was trusted for their mission, Hoskins argued that the powers that be couldn't trust the Division to get the job done, hence the Hunters being activated as \u201cguard dogs\u201d. She later shared the USB to Theo, where the latter expressed some disappointment the list of the world's most dangerous people was held in a \u201ccheap piece of plastic\u201d. Though Theo was alarmed that Hoskins had to take side roads to avoid the Hunters considering he wiped the data that implicated her, she retorted that Hunters became aware that a Division agent got into the bunker's secret entrance using an SHD Tech explosive, but not which agent. \n\nA little later, Keener had some doubts about the fight against the Hunters, then subsequently shared his plan by having [[Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas|a Hunter embedded into Black Tusk]] to undermine the Hunters. Hoskins was doubtful, not believing that anyone is that connected, though Keener corrected her that he's very well-connected. \n\nWhen Keener was coming up for a base of operations to build up new recruits and train them, Hoskins had some doubts given his reputation. But all in all, it worked, as many civilians who were rescued by Keener and Theo Parnell spoke in praise of Rogue Agents. However, Hoskins had some concerns when it turned out Theo consummated with Maral McCarthy (the woman that Theo rescued twice in Lower Manhattan) and got the young woman pregnant. Hoskins shared with Keener about her time with childbirth when she was an EMT, talking about the bad and worst cases she went through, like a child dying after birth. And expressed her worries for Theo, as she didn't want him to face the same thing that other parents did.\n\n== Conversations with Theo Parnell ==\nWhen Hoskins made it out of [Redacted] and went back to Keener's settlement in Brooklyn, she gave the USB drive that holds the Hunter's roster to Theo Parnell. Theo was a bit disappointed at first due to the roster held within a small plastic thumb drive. Hoskins remarked how difficult it was for her in leaving [Redacted] as she had to take side-roads to avoid Cal's Hunters, which shocked Theo as he wiped the data and the Hunters shouldn't know of her presence. Hoskins mentioned that she used SHD Tech explosive to open up the secret room from the Hunter bunker, and it didn't take a lot for the Hunters to figure out the intruder was a Division Agent, they just don't know which Agent.\n\nLater on, Hoskins was approached by Theo about the secret room in that Hunter bunker. Hoskins talked about it and when asked if she made it further in there, Hoskins admitted that she couldn't that as she lacked the \u201cClassified\u201d security clearance. This prompted Theo to sarcastically congratulate her as the first person to be tech-blocked by ISAC in a Hunter bunker.\n\nA little after, Hoskins was approached by Theo regarding her marriage and her son, which led to her correctly deducing that Theo has a crush on Maral McCarthy. Despite his denial at first and joking about his ego, Hoskins encouraged Theo to ask Maral out on a date, advising him to give her a moment of normal and kindness if he wants to have Maral as his girlfriend. Not long after, Theo approached Hoskins again, thanking her for the advice. When she asked him whether the Rogue Network is complete, Theo insisted for \u201ctomorrow\u201d. She also encouraged Theo to maintain balance between his personal life and professional life if he wants to keep his relationship with Maral intact.\n\nAfter a while, Maral got pregnant, so Hoskins was with Keener and Theo when discussing this. Hoskins suggested to Theo about the various ways to keep his pregnant girlfriend and his baby healthy. A little after, Hoskins was approached by Theo, asking her how she maintained balance between an EMT, a wife, and a mother. She admitted that she did not and gave her husband more credit for his part in maintaining the family life.

Their leader, Commander [[Healy]], was spearheading the assault. Inside the station, Dr. [[Jessica Kandel]], a virologist vital to the Division's efforts to counter the [[Green Poison]], was trapped. Her security team had been overwhelmed, and her life was in immediate jeopardy.\n\nDivision agents were dispatched by helicopter, piloted by [[Casey Bell]]. Upon arrival, the team found the station engulfed in flames and chaos. The Cleaners had breached the perimeter, using flamethrowers, molotov cocktails, and their newly developed weapon - [[Purple Flame]], a corrosive incendiary agent that melted barriers, breached defenses, and created lingering hazardous zones that rendered large areas impassable.\n\nInside, the station had become a warzone. Agents were forced into brutal close-quarters combat, maneuvering through tight hallways and exposed courtyards while contending with the Cleaners' aggressive tactics.\n\nThe operation's climax came in the command center, where Healy made his last stand. Armed with advanced Cleaner tech and a prototype Purple Flame weapon, he turned the battlefield into a flaming gauntlet. He ignited flammable surfaces, rigged corridors with traps, and called in elite reinforcements to flank the agents. The battle was long and punishing, pushing the team to their limits. After a brutal firefight, Healy was finally brought down.\n\nIn the aftermath, the agents located Dr. Kandel, who had been hiding in a secure storage area. Dr. Kandel was evacuated safely to [[The Bridge]], the fortified settlement serving as a haven for survivors and Division operatives in Brooklyn. Her survival - and the intel she carried - proved critical. Not only did it enable further research into the Purple Flame, but it also allowed the Division to mount a wider response to the Cleaners\u2019 chemical threat.",
  "Richard Danvers": "{{Character_Infobox|full name=Richard Danvers|nationality=American|age=Unknown|status=Deceased (''Killed-In-Action'')|occupation=Leader of the [[Cleaners]]<br/>[[Black Tusk]] Officer|factions=[[Black Tusk]]<br/>[[Cleaners]] (''Leader'')<br/>[[Rikers]] (''Supplier'')|people=[[Natalya Sokolova]]<br/>[[Sarah Moretti|\"Rat Queen\"]] (''Apprehended'')<br/>[[Matthew Grant]]<br/>[[Jasinski]] (''Deceased'')<br/>[[Wright]] (''Deceased'')<br/>[[The Lovebirds|Martinez & Johnson]] (''Both deceased'')<br/>[[Marty \"Sparrow\" Kincaid]] (''Deceased, presumably'')}}\n\n'''Richard Danvers''' is the mysterious leader and supplier of the [[Cleaners]], and the main antagonist in the [[Battle for Brooklyn]] DLC. During the events of [[Army Terminal]], it is revealed that Danvers was actually a high-ranking Black Tusk officer all along, working under [[Natalya Sokolova]]'s orders to lead the Cleaners and attack Brooklyn. It is also revealed he was the one in charge of the Cleaners' operation at the [[Paradise Lost|Meret Estate]].\n\n== History ==\nLittle is known about Danvers' past or how he joined the Black Tusk, but he eventually climb up their ranks to become one of Natalya Sokolova's most trusted officers, and was put in charge of becoming the Cleaners' new leader after Vivian Conley's death. Alongside SFX artist [[Matthew Grant]], Danvers would manufacture a powerful new accelerant for the Cleaners' incediaries called \"the purple flame\" (or \"Greek Fire\", in some instances). Using this experimental weapon, he would be ordered by Sokolova to lead an operation alongside Cleaner Commander and [[Hunters|Hunter Program]] Agent [[Wright]] to recover [[Mackenzie Meret]] from her Estate, in which they would also take the opportunity to test-run their new weapon.\n\nDespite the failure of the mission itself, the results of the Purple Flame's capacities were considered a major success, as such, Danvers' Cleaners would begin to mass-produce the weapon at the H5 Refinery in Brooklyn, where their troops would also launch a massive attack in the city's Dumbo region in an attempt to capture Doctor [[Jessica Kandel]] and recover [[Gordon Amherst|Gordon Amherst's]] 3D Printer from [[The Bridge|The Bridge Settlement]], thanks to intel given by the [[Rikers]]' new leader, the \"[[Sarah Moretti|Rat Queen]]\", who was once a close friend to [[Theo Parnell]] and a member of the Settlement, where Kandel originally was at. This prompted [[Melanie Hoskins]] to call for backup, bringing [[The Sheriff|agents]] from [[Washington, D.C.]] to their aid.\n\nThe D.C. agents would slowly dismantle Danvers' operation by recovering key power positions from Dumbo and invading the H5 Refinery, where Cleaners Commander [[Jasinski]] would go as far as to deploy an experimental Warhound, \"[[Violet warhound|Violet]]\", supplied by Danvers himself, in a attempt to stop the agents, but to no avail. Despite their best efforts and having defeated the Cleaners on-site, the agents would not be able to stop the self-destruction of the refinery, as they were warned by Hoskins that the Rikers (under Danvers' orders) were simultaneously attacking The Bridge.\n\nDefending the Bridge from the Rikers' attack, and counter-attacking by taking down their main bases and depots throughout the Brooklyn Heights region, the agents would launch an attack at their stronghold in [[The Art Museum]], where they would learn of the Rat Queen's true identity as Theo's former FRIEND [[Sarah Moretti]], and apprehend her for questioning. Under interrogation, Sarah would reveal the location of Danvers' stronghold at the old [[Army Terminal]], south of the Bridge. The agents would assault the compound, taking down Cleaner forces guarding the entrance until, once entering the laboratory itself, discovering the Site was a secret Black Tusk stronghold that was being used as an R&D lab for experimental tech using the Purple Flame, such as Flame Warhounds equipped with the purple accelerant, as well as other prototypes. The agents would eventually locate a massive Small-modular-reactor with nuclear properties being used to power the whole facility, as well as a massive armored Zeppelin. Danvers and his crew would board the zeppelin, which was armed with Purple Flame bombs, and lift off with course set for the bridge, which they planned to destroy. The agents would begin hacking multiple SAM Launchers on the stronghold's roof with the help of [[ANNA]], which would lead Danvers to activate an experimental [[XB-31 \"Marauder\"|Marauder]] drone equipped with a powerful laser generator that could set anything on fire to protect the zeppelin. Defeating the Marauder, the SAM launchers would blow the zeppelin out of the sky, stopping the Black Tusk's plan and killing Danvers in the process.\n\n== Personality and Traits ==\nWIP.\n\n== Abilities ==\nRichard Danvers is the final boss of Battle for Brooklyn's final mission, the Army Terminal. He pilots a massive Black Tusk Zeppelin equipped with Purple Flame Mortar Launchers and 3 bottom-mounted [[DDP-52 Razorback|Razorback]] stations that can deploy massive amounts of [[Drone (Skill)|Striker Drones]]. His zeppelin can't be damaged by normal means, as such, the agents must use ANNA to hack the local SAM Launchers in order to destroy it.\n\nDanvers also activates a massive [[LM-21 \"Marauder\"]] quadcopter drone equipped with missile launchers and a powerful Laser in place of its usual Minigun.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* Similar to [[Charles Bliss]] in the first game, Danvers serves as the campaign's overarching antagonist behind many of the events, and, much like him, is never actually encountered in person throughout the story, instead, dying aboard an armored aircraft that serves as the final boss encounter.\n* Through his dialogue giving orders to [[Marty \"Sparrow\" Kincaid]] throughout the Army Terminal mission, it can be speculated that Danvers was also behind the Black Tusk's operation to supply the [[Hyenas]] in [[Shades of Red]], as \"Sparrow\" was the direct contact between [[Bichon]] and the Black Tusk in [[Space Administration HQ: Theo Parnell]].\n* Although his face wasn't fully revealed, the found footage and ECHO collected from Army Terminal/Art Museum respectively gives a somewhat close look at Danvers' face. A bald Caucasian man with full beard.\n** Additionally, his outfit features a unique blue shirt with a black chest rig over it and black pants, not utilizing a full Black Tusk uniform. His model also features what appears to be a [[Smart Watch|SHD Smartwatch]] on his right wrist.\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:Cleaners]]\n[[Category:Enemies]]\n[[Category:Black Tusk]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]",

To make [[The Bridge]] vulnerable, Danvers ordered him to attack the [[CERA Clinic]] and burn the entire place to the ground.\n\n[[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] Agents who arrived recently to Brooklyn also went to the clinic to rescue the people working there. But it was too late, as Stewart and his Cleaners killed the staff, including Dr. [[Patricia Thompson]].\n\nThe losses galvanized the agents to hunt Stewart down.

This, combined with a ported barrel, angled foregrip, and detachable buttstock, provided superior control and stability.\n\n==Usage==\nThe '''93R''' boasts the fastest rate of fire among any Sidearm, thanks to its rapid three-round burst after each trigger pull; with proper timing, one can achieve almost fully-automatic fire, albeit at the cost of uncontrollable vertical recoil, reticle bloom, and ultimately mediocre damage output outside of close range. \n\nSuffice to say, the 93R should not be equipped with consistent damage in mind: even landing all three rounds on target is typically less effective than a single shot from a harder-hitting Sidearm like a [[Rhino/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|'''Diceros''']], and its spray-and-pray methodology pairs poorly with most Pistol [[Talents/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Talents]], which emphasize precision shooting or frequent weapon swapping. It's best used when landing hits precedes dealing damage, such as building stacks using '''{{Gearset|Striker's Battlegear (The Division 2)|Striker's Battlegear}}''' without wasting ammunition - otherwise, just bring an actual Submachine Gun instead of this makeshift substitute.\n\n==Variants== \n[[File:93R Div2.png|thumb|200px|left]]\n===93R===\nThe 93R machine pistol offers rapid and deadly bursts of fire.

Based on a licensed prototype, the weapon is an amalgam of several modern rifles designs including the '''[[G36/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|G36]]''' and '''[[SCAR-H/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|SCAR-H]]'''. \n\nRemington's '''ACR-E''' carbine variant was intended to supplant the [[M4/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|'''M4''']]\u2019s\u00a0 role in the United States Army. Its short-stroke gas system obviates a buffer tube inside the stock and reduces overall length, and its detachable barrel prevents overheating and allows for use of multiple calibers.  \n\nBushmaster's civilian ACR variant is included in the form of the '''[[ACR SS]]'''.  \n\n==Usage==\nThe '''ACR''' is a user-friendly mid-range weapon with above-average damage and superb handling.

Recruiting a number of other First Wave agents to his cause and killing those who resisted, he developed his own ambitions for establishing order and a future for the country or possibly the world, even if he is accused of high treason and branded a traitor of the United States federal government to do it.\n\nWhile Keener's identity was shrouded throughout ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]'', his intentions were unraveled during the events of ''[[Warlords of New York]]'', making him somewhat of an antagonist whose intentions were far worse than that of [[Gordon Amherst]].\n\nIn Year 6 Season 1: [[First Rogue]], after he survived his encounter with the Division at Liberty Island. Keener went to D.C. to parley with them and build up an alliance against Black Tusk and the Hunters. Since then, the agents secured Keener, and he was put in house arrest at the White House's Panic Room, while the Division worked in finding Theo Parnell and Alani Kelso before he could share more of what he knows. \n\n==Before the Outbreak==\nKeener graduated from [[wikipedia:The Citadel|The Citadel]], the Military College of South Carolina, before serving in the Navy as a Coastal Riverine Squadron small boat operator and weapons expert. He served a tour of duty fighting the war on drugs in South America, and at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti and has a mild reputation as the sarcastic, yet charismatic individual. His military experience and education in military treatise and psychology made him an excellent candidate for [[Strategic Homeland Division|the Division]]. Eventually, Keener and his army buddy [[Carter \"Hornet\" Leroux|Carter Leroux]] was contacted by Division recruiter [[Elija \"Huntsman\" Le|Elija Le]] to join the Division. Keener and Leroux passed the psychological tests, they were then given [[Smart Watch|Smart Watches]] and joined The Division.\n\nKeener is noted to combine his military experience and decision-making skill to achieve extensive success in the private sector. Upon leaving the military, Keener took up a job as a futures trader on [[Wall Street]]. Keener is labelled to be adaptable and confident, where he always assumes that he is going to come out on top.\n\nKeener is twice divorced. However, he maintains friendly relationships with both ex-wives. One of them has described Keener as too much work to keep up with.\n\nKeener also has a privileged upbringing and has never faced real adversity. Despite this, he has been able to overcome any obstacle through a combination of willpower and intelligence. Keener also has a personable character, enabling him to get others to work together to achieve his goals.\n\nKeener was thus noted to be a \"potentially prototypical candidate\" for joining the Division. This is probably due to his intellect as a person, as well as his military expertise from his time in military school as well as his time serving the military.\n\n\n==Tom Clancy's The Division==\nKeener was part of the First Wave of [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents to be activated after the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] of [[Green Poison]]. One of his objectives given by The Division was to secure what would be known as the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]], constructed to contain the infected citizens. However, [[CERA]] and [[Joint Task Force]] lost control of the Dark Zone quickly after its establishment and ordered all forces to pull out at all costs, including Keener and his fellow First Wave agents, forcing them to leave behind expensive equipment and any hope of ever establishing order in the region.\n\nDuring the JTF's retreat, Aaron was leading a group of civilians out of the Dark Zone when they were ambushed by a group of [[Rikers]]. Keener sheltered the civilians in an apartment building and fended off the overwhelming number of Rikers all by himself. He radioed the JTF for reinforcements but was denied despite explaining his situation. One of the Rikers then threw a Molotov cocktail into the building, killing everyone inside except for Keener who managed to escape and/or kill all the attackers. These incidents changed Keener's perspective of the federal government and left him disenchanted with his role as a Division agent, feeling a great deal of anger and betrayal. As such, he made the choice of turning rogue against the Division.\n\nSometime between Keener turning rogue and joining the [[Last Man Battalion]], he and [[Carter \"Hornet\" Leroux|Leroux]] encountered a fireman and his family. The fireman was threatened by [[Rioters]]. Despite Keener having been rogue agent already, he helped the family. He then told the family that he can protect them and get them to safety. Keener pointed them towards New Jersey and told them to stay low, avoid going into crowds. Later, Leroux asked him why he helped the family, Keener replies that he admired the fireman stepping up to the rioters, while the logical solution was to run away.\n\nHis first actions after turning rogue were to gather as many First Wave agents as possible, intending to form a unit of rogue agents to work for him in future operations. Agents who chose not to ally with him were executed by Keener in cold blood, and eventually, the entirety of the First Wave went missing or was killed. This event had triggered The Division to deploy the Second Wave of agents to investigate what had happened to the First Wave, coupled with continuing the mission to restore order in New York.\n\nKeener met [[Charles Bliss]], the commanding officer of the Last Man Battalion. Keener wanted to make use of the Last Man Battalion to establish dominance over [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]], while Bliss wanted to take advantage of Keener's [[SHD Tech|SHD technology]] to get an advantage over other factions controlling Manhattan. Together, Keener and the Last Man Battalion had launched many operations against belligerent factions, including the JTF.\n\nOne of the joint operations conducted in the bombing of an osprey helicopter carrying the Second Wave of Division agents into Manhattan, killing everyone aboard, including the [[Louis Chang|Division Commander]] tasked with leading the Second Wave. The bombing also resulted in [[Faye Lau]] being critically injured, as well as knocking another agent unconscious.\n\nWhile conducting the operations with the Last Man Battalion, Keener also investigated [[The Outbreak|the outbreak]] on his own, eventually discovering that [[Gordon Amherst]]\u00a0was responsible for the Outbreak. After Faye Lau discovered several bodies of the First Wave agents, clues pointing to Aaron Keener started to emerge, introducing Aaron Keener to the Player. After the [[Police Academy]]\u00a0mission, the player first caught a glimpse of Keener through a recovered CCTV footage, which showed Keener convincing a [[Scarecrow|fellow Rogue agents]] to defect after the JTF and Division\u2019s disastrous and costly failure to hold the Dark Zone.\n\nLater on, the player is tasked to save Dr. [[Vitaly Tchernenko]] from the [[Russian Consulate]]. Keener was contacted by [[Tegan \"Luna\" Silver|Tegan Silver]], a follower of Keener's cause, citing an assault on the consulate was imminent. Keener contacted Leroux and warned him about it. When the player waited for him to open the secret door to the panic room, Leroux break-in, taking Tchernenko to a chopper seen leaving by the player, the player injured Leroux. The chopper is presumed to be heading towards an LMB base for Keener, later revealed to be the [[General Assembly|U.N. Headquarters]].\n\nHowever, once the JTF and the Division storm the U.N. Headquarters to drive out the LMB and eliminate Bliss (with a secondary object to find Tchernenko and Keener), an [[ECHO]] reveals that Keener sees that the LMB are finished and instead takes Tchernenko with him while ordering two other rogue agents to stall the Second Wave agents and also jam the Division tracking hardware to prevent them following him, after which they would regroup at another location (the location of which at this time is unknown). This was to earn Bliss' anger at Keener for betraying the LMB.\n\nAfter Bliss was killed and the U.N. Headquarters was secured by the JTF, an ECHO [[Unknown Signal|reveals]] that Keener had found Amherst's lab, as well as some virus samples, a 3D DNA printer, and also Amherst's notes and ideas. Following on from an earlier discussion he had with another First Wave agent, he stole as much as he could put into a duffel bag, then left a message (via his hacked SHD Tech) for any Second Wave agent who picked up the signal and then took off. At this point in time, thanks to Faye Lau and the Second Wave, the JTF and the U.S. government are now and well truly aware of Keener's activities and intentions, with him now wanted for high treason and the possibility of being registered as a terrorist now.\n\nKeener found [[Lori \"Termite\" Baker|Lori Baker]], a Rogue Division agent and a field surgeon. Keener asked Baker to join the team and told him that they are going to eradicate the weak. Baker accepted his proposition. Later, Keener went back to the Russian Consulate at some point, to retrieve the injured Leroux. Right after he took him to Baker. Leroux promised Keener he won't fail him again and Baker nursed him back to good health.\n\nWith the recent deployment of both The Division and the JTF to the [[West Side Pier]] to help secure the area, Second Wave agents have recovered numerous smartphone messages out in the field, with five of them being left behind by Keener himself. These messages revealed that he was also in the West Side Pier district earlier to hunt down a few things that he needed for his plans, given the fact that by now, according to him, that both Central and Eastern Manhattan had 'been picked clean' of anything useful to him. Keener then states that he decided to broadcast his location in West Side Piers in order to drag all the warring [[factions]] (all of them apparently having various feuds against Keener, the reasons of which are unknown, with the exception of the LMB) to the area to chase him, which in doing so, dragged the JTF and The Division to the area in order to keep them occupied and 'keep their eyes off the prize'. \n\nAfter revealing this, he then starts to taunt the agents about how no one will find him, no matter what before revealing that despite the Quarantine Lockdown on the island, with the U.S. Coast Guard/U.S. Navy's blockade on the Hudson and the JTF guarding all tunnels and bridges out of Manhattan, Keener was able to either slip past the patrols or, more likely, bribed someone in either organization (be either with a false promise of hope or by force) in order to let him through and off the island.\n\nHis last message states that he is now well and truly gone, and also reveals that he's got his eyes set on not just the United States but now the world. Once again, Keener attempts to try and convince the agents that working for groups like the JTF or the U.S. government is not worth the time and effort, and should they finally see his way and beliefs, then he might be able to allow them to work together. The final thing that Keener states is that should any Second Wave agent (once they start to follow his line of thinking) is able to finally get out of Manhattan, he said not to look for him but rather he would come to them when the time was right.\n\nThanks to the intel gathered by Manhattan's second wave, Keener's agent status has been electronically revoked and is now wanted for high treason with the strong possibility of being placed on both the U.S. government's and Interpol's Most Wanted list.\n\nAt this point in time, Aaron Keener's location is currently unknown but now confirmed that he is no longer in Manhattan, possibly in New York City altogether.\n\n\n==Tom Clancy's The Division 2==\nSix months later, dozens of audio logs left behind by Aaron Keener show up in [[Washington, D.C.]], indicating that Keener is still at large. One of the audio logs found in Washington, D.C. talks about the quarantine around [[New York City]] falling apart, indicating that he has returned to N.Y.C. within the time between ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''.\n\nIn [[Coney Island/Title Update 7|Episode 3]] of ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'', which takes place on [[Coney Island]] in Brooklyn, after the Russian Scientist [[Vitaly Tchernenko]] successfully engineered a more lethal chemical agent based on the [[Green Poison]], he gave Vitaly Tchernenko to a battalion of [[Black Tusk]], in exchange for unspecific support in his future projects, according to him. It is still uncertain what Keener wants from the Black Tusk, but one thing however certain is that Keener intended on double-crossing the Black Tusk all along. During or before his deal with the Black Tusk, he informed [[Vivian Conley]], a Rogue Division agent and the current leader of the [[Cleaners]], that the Black Tusk has Tchernenko all along, and\u00a0Keener tells Conley to bring her Cleaners to kill all the Black Tusk on Coney Island and get to Tchernenko so she and the Cleaners can have their revenge since Tchernenko help create the Green Poison. However, in reality, Keener was the one who held Tchernenko as a prisoner in a secret location. After Conley sent her Cleaners on Coney Island to kill Tchernenko, and a squad of Division agents from Washington, D.C. raid the Island, Aaron fled during the chaos, once again one step ahead of everyone.\n\nIt is later on revealed that when he had Vitaly Tchernenko in his custody and with the possession of [[Gordon Amherst|Dr. Amherst]]'s notes of the Green Poison, he engineered his own deadly biological virus and along with his other fellow four rogue agents, he attacked the Division's [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]] in Manhattan killing top [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division agents]] and analysts. He then went on to take control of four districts in Lower Manhattan and each of the four districts are given to his four rogue agents. He managed to secure an understanding between the [[Cleaners]] and the [[Rikers]]. The two factions now serve as allies to him and his band of rogue agents.\n\nAs of now, the [[Strategic Homeland Division]] has launched a [[Warlords of New York|Manhunt]] on him and his lieutenants.\n\n\n==Pre-Warlords of New York==\nMonths after the Second Wave [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents reclaimed the city, Keener met [[James Dragov]], a fellow [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Division]] agent who was also the leader of the [[Rikers]], right after Keener killed several of the Rikers to threaten Dragov. Keener then offered a partnership between them, with Dragov providing Keener with supplies, as well as help on certain occasions.\n\nKeener then brought Dragov along to find [[Theo Parnell]] and recruit him. Keener met Parnell at the Arch in [[Lower Manhattan]]. Parnell pointed his gun at Keener at first sight, while Keener kept calm, and persuaded Parnell to join his cause. He persuaded him by confirming his suspicions on his father's death and telling him that [[Strategic Homeland Division|the Division]] is corrupt from the people at the higher up. Little did Parnell know if he failed to turn rogue, Dragov will shoot him dead from behind.\n\nKeener then met with [[Vivian Conley]], a fellow Rogue Division agent and now the leader of the [[Cleaners]]. Conley was surprised to see Keener, assuming he had been killed in the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]] retreat. Keener then thanked Conley for saving him with her turret and offered her partnership. Conley rejected at first, but Keener persuaded her in the end.\n\nKeener then found [[Javier Kajika]], a Rogue Division agent at the tunnels. Keener persuaded Kajika to join him, in return for the names of the people that betrayed Kajika and his squad during a previous mission.\n\nKeener found his Division recruiter, [[Elija \"Huntsman\" Le|Elija Le]], and sought to recruit him for his cause. Keener introduced him to [[Tegan \"Luna\" Silver|Tegan Silver]], and have him the codename \"Huntsman\". Le eventually accepted his proposition.\n\nKeener found [[Jason \"Titan\" Barnes|Jason Barnes]], a Rogue Division agent and an eco-terrorist, and manipulated him into joining his team of rogue agents. Barnes joined as his goal was to eradicate humanity. Although Keener had a different goal, but their methods of doing it are more or less the same, by committing mass murder.\n\nBefore attacking the Base of Operations in Lower Manhattan, Keener had orchestrated a plan to attack [[Washington, D.C.]] Unable to fulfill the plan himself, Keener found [[Molly \"Jupiter\" Henderson|Molly Henderson]], a Rogue Division agent. He tasked her to carry out his plan. To do so, Keener told Henderson to assemble a team of rogue Division agents, while Keener told Conley to give Henderson some Cleaners support.\n\n\n==Warlords of New York==\n''Main article: [[Warlords of New York]]''\n\nAaron Keener, along with his four [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Division]] agents, launched biological attacks on multiple sites in [[New York City]] limits, mainly targeted [[Joint Task Force]] facilities and highly populated area, one of those include the [[New York City Hall]].\n\n[[Faye Lau]], acting commander of [[Strategic Homeland Division|the Division]] in New York, requested emergency help from [[Washington, D.C.]] Division Agent [[Alani Kelso]] and the player then travel to [[New York City]] to assist with the situation. Through a surveillance video in the City Hall, the player identifies the perpetrators of the attack as First Wave Rogue Division agents [[Vivian Conley|Vivan Conley]], [[Theo Parnell]], [[James Dragov]], [[Javier Kajika|Javier Kaijika]] with the infamous rogue agent Aaron Keener leading them. The Division in New York then launched a manhunt for Keener and his rogue agents.\n\nHaving difficulty tracking the rogue agents with the limited data, the player starts tracking the rogue agents with intel from the [[Peacekeepers]]. In the meantime, Keener prepared his endgame for the world. With Dragov providing the supplies, and Parnell with his technological expertise, Keener was able to build Ground to Air missiles for spreading the virus, more lethal forms of [[SHD Tech|SHD Techs]] and a Rogue Agent network.\n\nAfter the player defeats Conley, Kajika, Parnell, and Dragov, the player was able to give their smartwatches for Faye Lau to pinpoint Keener's exact location, which she said, and tracked Keener to [[Liberty Island]]. Agent Kelso and the player then proceeded to the ferry terminal for transport to the Liberty Island to kill Keener. Faye Lau revealed to be working with the [[Black Tusk]], told [[Bardon Schaeffer]] where Keener is located at, which led to Schaeffer sending Black Tusk forces on the ferry terminal to stop the agents from having Keener killed or captured while wanting to kill Keener himself.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful interception for the Division agents at the ferry terminal, Schaeffer launched a missile attack on the Division agents' ferry, destroying the boat, but the agents survived. Keener watched the whole thing through cams, then he hacked into the [[SHD Network]] and teased the agents.\n\nSchaeffer sent Black Tusk ground forces to kill Keener, while the player stops the overwhelming ground forces. Schaeffer then sent a [[DDP-52 Razorback|Razorback]] drone platform to kill Keener, which the player stopped almost immediately. In a final attempt to kill Keener, Schaeffer sent his last [[XB-31 \"Marauder\"|Marauder]] Class Quadcopter to kill the player and Keener. Keener, having advanced SHD Tech, hacks the Quadcopter and uses it against the player. The player however prevailed in eliminating the quadcopter. After all the Black Tusk forces on the island are dead, Keener then asked the player to meet him inside. Using ECHO, he explained to the player his agenda and attacked the player with more advanced SHD Tech. The player again prevailed and chased Keener to outside the Statue of Liberty. Keener then attempted to launch his Ground to Air missile containing [[Vitaly Tchernenko|Tchnernenko]]'s new [[Eclipse Virus]]. In the final seconds, the player stopped the machine. Keener pissed at his lifelong work being destroyed, went to kill the player. \n\nAlthough Keener fought hard with his skills and techs, Keener was fatally wounded by the player in the fight. Keener then attempted to escape to the pier, but his wounds prevented that from happening. Agent Kelso and the player then approached Keener. Keener, having one last trick up his sleeve, activated his Rogue Agents' network, then warned the Division agents, saying \"you have no idea what is coming\", as his last breath. The agent then grabbed Keener's smartwatch, while the [[Rogue Network]] revealed that Faye Lau had gone rogue to work with the Black Tusk, while Keener's watch broadcasted the live conversation between Lau and Schaeffer.\n\n\n== The Prodigal Son returns ==\nHowever, it would turn out that his supposed death in [[Liberty Island]] wasn't true after all as [[ISAC]] didn't identify the deceased agent, making it seem that the Keener who was killed was a body double. Throughout the comms collected in ''[[Vanguard|Y5S3: Vanguard]]'', its also revealed that [[Theo Parnell]] survived through manipulating ISAC and using a [[Decoy]] as well as a copy of [[ANNA]]. This allowed the two to stay under the radar and work on deploying the [[Rogue Network]] nationally.\n\nDuring the events of WONY, he secretly worked with [[Faye Lau]] so they could work together in taking down the [[Black Tusk]] and the [[Hunters]] once and for all which included a secret weapon found within a SHD Crate in a safehouse. That same crate also shocked and knocked out [[Alani Kelso|Agent Kelso]] due to lacking two-factor authentication when she attempted to open it. Despite Lau's death being a setback, Keener continued on his work and managed to recover Kelso while she was unconscious. Whatever their conversation was, he convinced her that the only way to stop Black Tusk and the Hunters is by working together. Seeing herself with no options and wanting to finish what Lau started, Kelso agreed to work with him.\n\nWhen [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents defeated the Black Tusk and [[True Sons]] forces in the area surrounding the [[Stranded Tanker (Manhunt: Alani Kelso)|Stranded Tanker]], they enter the tanker only to find the same SHD Crate. They were shocked and left unconscious when they attempted to open it, allowing Keener the opportunity to clone the ANNA system to his watch, opening the crate and take the briefcase with him. Alongside Parnell and Kelso (now [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue]]), he escaped [[New York City]] in a van, taking them possibly to [[Brooklyn]].\n\nAfter the events at the tanker, Keener sent a message to Division agents in [[Haven]], hoping to build a bridge and sway them to his side. He believes that the Division as an organization is a lost cause and that more innocent and good people will die as long as [[Natalya Sokolova]] and [[Calvin McManus]] remain in the picture. He tells them that a safe haven is awaiting them on the other side and hopes to see them soon.\n\n\n== The First Rogue ==\n[[File:Aaron Keener with SHD Agent 1.png|thumb|right|330px]]Keener makes his way to [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] As an invitation, he sent a message to a terminal in the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]]'s server room meant for [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents. Despite [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]] vouching for them, he's not willing to recruit them easily given their past confrontation. As such, he puts them to a series of four trials to prove their worth and hoping by the time they get to meet him personally, they truly understand the real threat to the Division.\n\nAs expected, the agents would survive their first trial; Echo. Keener gives his compliment and asks them for patience for their second trial, Hercules. Not long aftter that, the agents completes the Hercules trial, impressing Keener. He congratulates them, hoping that the agents starts to appreciate the extent of his Rogue Network and what they could offer to the table. And with Leto trial coming up, he hopes they're up for the challenge.\n\nThe comms intercepted by the agents during the first two trials reveals Keener's correspondence with Bridgette Douglas and Melanie Hoskins. With Douglas, they talk about their personal histories, keeping watch on President Ellis, and trying to make sure that [[Faye Lau|\"Cassandra\"]] fulfills her part. With Hoskins, he tried to convince her to his cause by sharing an audio recording of Calvin McManus' neglect over Gordon Amherst as well as checking up on her after she visited her family in the stables farm.\n\nDuring the agents' venture to Leto trial, they learn from Keener regarding Manny's mindset about Kelso and awareness of the former's actions in D.C. In addition to the intercepted comms, he also leaves some notes for the agents, where he expresses his philosophy and the sacrifices he's making waiting for said agents to complete their trials.\n\nEventually, the agents managed to complete the final trial, Nyx. As a gesture of good will, Keener has proof about Cal's Hunters roster and a base they set up and implores the agents to meet him at the Federal Emergency Bunker. However, Black Tusk intercepted comms between Manny and Keener from earlier.\n\nIn a race against time, the agents rushed to the Bunker and faced off against Black Tusk personnel. They eventually get to meet Keener, but were confronted by an experimental [[Warhound]] codenamed [[Chimera]]. Working together, Division agents focused on the striker drones while Keener focused on disabling Chimera's shields. By the third time Keener disabled the shields, Chimera couldn't sustain any more damage from the agents, leading it to its destruction. After this ordeal, Keener took a case filled with ANNA gear for new recruits and goes to meet Manny in person, bidding farewell to the agents and looking forward to working with them.\n\n[[File:Aaron Keener with SHD Agent 2.png|thumb|right|330px]]When the agents get to the White House, Keener is found in a cell in the Panic Room in the White House's basement. As established from comms correspondence between Keener and Manny, Keener agreed to the latter's terms by allowing himself to be taken into custody by the Division and will stay there until Agent Kelso reveals herself and vets him. In the meantime, Keener's work with the agents will continue under a few conditions for now.\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Shades of Red ==\nAs part of their first mission together, Division agents meet up with Aaron Keener in his cell at the White House where he reveals that he was separated from Theo Parnell and Alani Kelso when they came to Washington, D.C thanks to a Black Tusk's \"welcoming party\" and were supposed to meet up at an RV point before Keener surrendered himself to custody. As such, the agents must follow Theo's trail across the Capitol to find him\n\nDuring their trail, the agents uncover comms that details more of Keener's activities over the last several months. Thanks to Vivian Conley's former association with DARPA engineer-turned Black Tusk Operative Mathias \"Trig\" Schneider, he and Parnell learn about the Combat simulation program and its technology. They visited Washington D.C to procure a copy of the simulation program and dozens of Mobile SHD Servers. Keener was involved with Parnell tweaking the simulation's tech, which allowed them to deceive ISAC and the Division during the events of WONY.\n\nIn addition, more comms related to Keener were uncovered from the NSA Databases while the Division kept playing in the simulation. Those comms  first involve his conversations with Bridgette Douglas. One conversation involved him mourning for the loss of the Morretti's patriarch and daughter, with the matriarch as the only survivor. But for the most part, the conversations involve Keener doing his recruiting drive with Douglas where he looked into recruiting smembers of the Castle Settlement for his settlement. Those conversations concluded with Douglas convincing Keener to not go forward with recruiting them as those members' mindsets and ideologies could be incompatible with what he has in mind for his settlement\n\nOne comm in particular had Keener conversing with Parnell about the events that transpired in Meret Estate. While Keener was glad the Division managed to repel the Cleaner assault and saved Mackenzie Meret and the rest of the survivors from certain death, he was concerned when the Cleaner couple The Lovebirds used Rogue SHD Tech, suggesting to take a look at their inventory to find out where it came from.\n\nAfter Theo Parnell was rescued and secured in the White House, a few comms were recovered involving Keener's activities with Parnell prior to the events of WONY. One comm has him discuss the simulated scan of himself looks different, which Keener used to his advantage. Keener suggesting Parnell his dead father, Henry, to lure the Cabal out of hiding. And lastly, Keener vouching for Douglas when Parnell reviewd the Hunter Roster from that USB Drive that confirmed her as a Hunter.\n\nA final comm recovered from the Combat Simulation Program had Keener discussing with Douglas about Bardon Schaeffer's risky plan in getting himself captured by the Division. While the plan did work as Schaeffer was apprehended, he's in a coma due to sustaining critical wounds and wasn't able to deliver Faye's message to the agents.\n\n\n== Burden of Truth ==\nAaron Keener is still in his cell while Division agents follow Agent Kelso's trail across the Capitol to find her. Throughout the trail, they recovered intel that unveiled further truth about Faye Lau, the Cassandra mission, Bardon Schaeffer, and Keener's involvement in all of this.\n\n=== Honey Pot ===\nAfter Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas met with Faye Lau, she was hesitant to be truthful. Keener encouraged her to be honest, emphasizing that relationships built on lies never survives. When questioned by his friend over his supposed emotional maturity, Keener admits that he was envious of the human connection he saw with Theo Parnell/Maral McCarthy and the Moretti family, feeling like he could've had something like that with his crush, Mackenzie Meret.\n\n=== Meet Cute ===\nAfter listening in to \"Viper\" meeting with Faye Lau, Keener felt the latter could be dangerous for Douglas when it comes to their relationship, even suggesting his friend to not go into bed with her often. Though, he'd relent when Douglas mentioned that will blow her cover as most combat personnel spend their downtime bedding each other.\n\n=== Mission ===\nKeener discussed with \"Viper\" about Faye Lau's mission to intercept and eliminate the POTUS: Andrew Ellis. Despite some apprehension from Douglas, Keener felt what Lau is doing is no less dangerous than what she had already done. He had some misgivings about Lau having to play nice with the president, but pushed that aside as Ellis was the only one with access to The Ark Protocol.\n\n=== Red Light ===\nKeener was informed by Viper that Lau is accepting her mission, which made him happy. He was also informed that Lau is also going through Natalya Sokolova's tests for her new BTSU and antagonise Bardon Schaeffer for Nat's pleasure. This confused Keener, as he knew Schaeffer was a loyal officer for Nat. He'd learn from \"Viper\" that Schaeffer's failures against the Division had him kicked from Ellis's security detail and was in Nat's \"shit-list\". \n\nAfter \"Viper\" clarified Nat's leadership style and its folly, Keener noted that Nat sounds more like a psychopath.\n\n=== Chickenhawk ===\nKeener was with \"Viper\" and Schaeffer during the discussion about The Ark's key, as Douglas informed them that President Ellis liked Faye Lau enough that he wanted her in his security detail. This satisfied Keener, as his plan was working. Though considering the possible scenario of the President's death, he was informed that the \n\n=== Recruiter ===\nKeener discussed about the Hunters with \"Vipes, more specifically discussing Brian Johnson, aka The Recruiter, and whether she recognized him,. Douglas admits she does not, but he sounded famililar as she possible saw him during Hunter training or in recruitment dinners with other Hunters like David, Joe, or Dicky. Keener noted how different their lives were before the Green Poison, and muses to Douglas that the Bridgette before that wouldn't have looked at Faye Lau twice. He admits that he likes Douglas with Lau, and muses if it's horrible that he's glad Amherst blew up the world, which Douglas says yes but admits that he's trying to be a good friend.\n\nThe discussion turns bitter when the reality hit that Schaeffer is in Division's custody and in a coma, with Keener noting that the agents are coming after Douglas and Lau next. Douglas was starting to cry and lamented over the situation, though Keener reminded her of quality, not quantity. Soon after, Douglas took her leave to see Lau one last time.\n\n=== Nat ===\nKeener was asked by Douglas if he had ever made excuses for someone's behavior that he forgot why he was friends with them in the first place. Keener admits that never happened to him as he never let people very close to him, and whenever they piss him off, he pushes them off. The discussion turns to Viper's former friendship with Mackenzie Meret, where she rants about Mack's negative behavior, emphasizing that she'll never change. Despite Keener's retort that Mackenzie is 40 years old, Viper argued that Mack has been like that since she was 16 and has no incentive to change.\n\nWhen Keener remarks if they're talking about Mack or Natalya Sokolova, Douglas noted that Nat is the saddest person she's ever met, even claiming that looking so perfect to others is her special ability. She then goes over Nat's approach in fulfilling people's hopes and dreams is through data and tech, particulary through the use of ISAC's database.\n\nKeener couldn't deicde if that ability is amazing or terrifying, with Douglas saying it's both.\n\n=== The Key ===\nKeener approaches Bardon Schaeffer and asks him about his offer, which Schaeffer accepted after he was convinced by Lau and Douglas. Keener then tells him he's \"The Key\" to unlock Nat's secret bunkers. Despite Schaeffer's warning about Nat not letting him near them, he emphasizes to Schaeffer on his part and trying to find a good reason to have the former BTSU commander inside the bunkers, so he could upload Theo Parnell's \"program\" where they could take over Black Tusk's tech.\n\n\nRegardless, with Keener's team secured and the truth uncovered, the Division's alliance with the Rogue Agent should be more solidified than ever.\n\n== Personality ==\nAaron Keener's personality before (and during) [[The Outbreak|the outbreak]] is that of high intelligence but also one that shows that he sure of himself and right all the time, regardless of whether he's right or wrong. Keener also possesses a very strong determination and perseverance to ensure he achieves his goals. As his profile states, due to his personable character, he is capable to have other help him either achieve one of his goals or a common objective. Despite this, he still felt a sense of duty to protect the weak and innocent as he escorted a group of civilians out of the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]] and fended off a group of [[Rikers]] attacking them. After being denied help and the civilians being killed by the Rikers, Aaron felt a great deal of anger and betrayal from the government as he believed he could've saved the civilians and the First Wave could've saved the Dark Zone all together had the government been more competent and allow the First Wave (as he puts it) \"to do their fucking job\". It is then he begins to lose faith in the government and any hope of restoring order in [[New York City]].\n\nFollowing his decision to go rogue and when the Second Wave starts to investigate him, Keener's personality has changed somewhat. While he still has his determination and perseverance, his attitude towards the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] and the U.S. government has changed dramatically. He now believes that rule and law no longer exist and now the only way to survive is by obtaining power. While Keener is still a personable character, he now uses others to help achieve his own goals - regardless of either their lives or the cost to others.\n\nWith the release of [[Patches and Updates/Update 1.8: Resistance|Update 1.8.]], Keener's personality has now changed considerably. Judging by his voice and also what his intentions are, it is possible that now he has developed a lust for power and also now possess a sadistic trait due to his views on the government, the JTF and why The Division is wasting their time helping people \"who aren't worth it\" and should be left behind. It is possible that he may also be starting to go insane.\n\nThe audio logs that Keener left behind through [[Washington, D.C.]] as dead drops indicate that he has a superiority complex and a massive ego, showing contempt and derision towards anyone who doesn't share his ideologies and ambitions.\n\nWith the help of the new biological weapons he has engineered, he wanted to create chaos and his lust for power has led him to control four districts in Lower Manhattan and he wanted to expand his control more. But as revealed in the comms from Year 5 Season 3 - Vanguard, it was a tool to root out Hunters secretely embedded as Division agents.\n\nKeener is also prone to paranoia, as during the fight in ANNA's control room, he taunts the agent by hacking into their system, asking them who can they trust.\n\nIn spite of his cruelty and ambitions, he does show moments of compassion on a few occasions. One of them was helping a family escape Downtown Manhattan, to the chagrin from one of his fellow [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Agents]]. He also showed kindness to [[Vitaly Tchernenko|Tchernenko]] during a failed experiment developing the [[Eclipse Virus]], as well as reassuring [[Carter \"Hornet\" Leroux|Hornet]] after coming back from the dead due to his failure from stopping the Division in the [[Russian Consulate]]. In addition, as revealed in the comms from Y5S3: Vanguard, he also helped rescuing civilians alongside his Rogues and sent them to a safe haven (Possibly in Brooklyn).\n\nWhat's more important to Keener is leaving a legacy when he dies. Seeing the tyranny in the [[Green Poison|post-Green Poison]] U.S., he sees anarchy as the only solution to end it. It is why he dedicated to make the [[Eclipse Virus]] and use it to wipe the slate clean and had [[Theo Parnell|Parnell]] develop the [[Rogue Network]] as a way for all rogue agents to enact their operations and continue his work if need be.\n\nWhile his intentions to stop Black Tusk and the Hunters may seem noble, his methods are anything but. In fact, when he attacked City Hall using the Eclipse Virus to eliminate any Division agents who were secretely embedded as Hunters, he killed a number of civillians, which almost risked losing his alliance with [[Faye Lau|\"Cassandra\",]] which also would've lost him a chance to take down Natalya Sokolova. He also vehemently believes that the Division as an organization is a lost cause as he tried to convince Division agents through a message (after the [[Stranded Tanker (Manhunt: Alani Kelso)|Stranded Tanker manhunt)]] he sent to them to join him as Rogues as he believes they'll see the light and work with him to put down Calvin McManus and Natalya Sokolova for good.\n\nIt must also be considered that while his focus right now is on Black Tusk and the Hunters, there's the crimes he committed. And if Black Tusk and the Hunters go out of the picture, he would still remain a theat due to the Rogue Network he helped establish and whether he intends to carve his own territory.\n\n\n==Abilities==\n\n=== Warlords of New York ===\nDuring his encounter on [[Liberty Island]], Keener was a [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Agent]] armed with a [[M4/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Police M4]], [[CMMG Banshee]], [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Concussion]], [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Flashbang]], [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Shock]], [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Incendiary]] and [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Riot Foam]] Grenades and nearly every [[SHD Tech|SHD Skill]] in the game.\n\nThese include:\n* [[Drone (Skill)|Drone]] (Defender, Striker, Fixer and Bombardier)\n* [[Turret]] (Assault, Incinerator, Sniper and Artillery)\n* [[Seeker Mine|Seeker-Mine]] (Explosive, Air-burst and Mender)\n* [[Chem Launcher|Chem-Launcher]] (Riot Foam, Firestarter, Oxidizer and Reinforcer)\n* [[Firefly]] (Blinder)\n* [[Hive]] (Stinger and Restorer)\n* [[Trap (Skill)|Trap]] (Shock; Hacked from the Player)\n* [[Decoy]] (Holographic Distraction; Hacked from the Player)\n* [[Pulse/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Pulse]] (Jammer and \"Hacker\")\nKeener has also shown the ability to hack [[Black Tusk]] tech, having hacked a Marauder-Class Quadcopter and many Warhounds, turning them against [[Strategic Homeland Division|the Division]] and the [[Black Tusk]].\n\n=== Year 6 Season 1 - First Rogue ===\nDuring the fight against [[Chimera]], Keener is a ''friendly'' Rogue Agent armed with a [[G36/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|G36 Enhanced]] and [[MP5/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|MP5-N]]. He also displays a heavy use of SHD [[Decoy|Hologram Decoys]], SHD [[Trap (Skill)|Shock and unique Laser Traps]] throughout the mission.\n\n==Known Criminal/Treason Charges==\n*Execution of [[civilians]]\n*Failure to prevent [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] deaths\n*Convincing many members of the [[Strategic Homeland Division|First Wave]] and [[Strategic Homeland Division|Second Wave]] to go [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue]]\n*Execution of loyal First Wave Division agents and assigned [[Louis Chang|Division Commander]]\n*Working alongside the [[Last Man Battalion]]\n*Massacring members of the Second Wave of Division agents and assigned Division Commander, save for [[Faye Lau]] and the Player (with LMB support)\n*Hindering Joint Task Force and the Division operations\n*Massacring people, diplomats, and VIPs in the [[Russian Consulate]] in [[New York City]]\n*Kidnapping Russian virologist [[Vitaly Tchernenko]]\n* Theft of [[Gordon Amherst|Gordon Amherst's]] notes, laptop, virus samples, and 3D biological printing unit\n*In tandem with the kidnapping and thievery charges, Keener made Tchernenko unwillingly create a new virus and vaccine, construed as handling illegal biological weapons and assets\n*Working with [[Black Tusk]]\n*Attacking the Division's [[N.Y.C.

One joked that Keener is \"too much work to keep up with.\"\n*During his encounter on Liberty Island, Keener's only SHD Skill that does not have the \"Hacked\" icon is the Defender Drone, suggesting all his other skills (with the exception of the Chem Launcher) are simply summoned from the SHD Tech Crates that are nearby, despite Keener actually having animations for deploying them.<br />\n== Missions ==\n===''Tom Clancy's The Division''===\n*[[Police Academy]] (ECHO)\n*[[General Assembly]] (ECHO)\n===''Tom Clancy's The Division 2''===\n*[[Wall Street (Mission)|Wall Street]] (ECHO)\n*[[The Tombs]] (Voice)\n*[[Liberty Island]]\n*[[Stranded Tanker (Manhunt: Alani Kelso)|Stranded Tanker: Alani Kelso]] (Cutscene)\n*[[Unknown ping]] (Voice)\n*[[The Rabbit Hole]] (Voice)\n*[[Federal Emergency Bunker: Aaron Keener]]\n==Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nAaron_Keener_WONY.png\nAaron_KeenerShades of Red.png\nTom-garden-tom-garden-the-division-keener.jpg|Aaron Keener character model art\nAaron Keener's Letter .JPG|Aaron's letter to Division agents\nScreenshot 20200211-205141 YouTube.jpg|Aaron Keener in the \"Warlords of New York\" Cinematic Trailer\nIMG 20200225 104752.jpg|Aaron Keener as he looks in the animated  Warlords of New York Trailer\nE8013041-0848-4280-9144-2D6A469743DB.jpeg|Aaron Keener\u2019s model in Warlords of New York\nAaron Keener.png\nFile:Aaron Keener ID.png|Aaron Keener's identification card\nFile:THE-DIVISION-2-WARLORDS-OF-NEW-YORK-5.jpg\nFile:Vlcsnap-2020-12-31-20h56m30s501.jpg\nFile:Vlcsnap-2020-12-31-20h56m09s831.jpg\nFile:Vlcsnap-2020-12-31-20h50m37s488.jpg\nFile:Vlcsnap-2020-12-31-20h54m01s246.jpg\nFile:Keener.png|Keener in [[Descent]]\nFile:Y6S1 KeyArt 4k No Logo.png\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Other Media==\n===''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad''===\n*Aaron Keener was featured in ''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad'' as part of the Rogue Agents faction.

With the advent of several Division agents who came to the city, she played a major part in coordinating efforts and assisting agents in the field with restoring the SHD Network and retaking the Capitol.   \n\nKelso was also involved in the events of [[Warlords of New York]], where she helped the agents neutralize Aaron Keener and his cell in [[Lower Manhattan]] in addition to helping agents in the Manhunts against Rogue Cells. The revelation of Faye Lau, a fellow agent who went rogue after WONY's campaign, shook her heavily And as such, she disavowed Lau as a traitor and was involved in the Manhunt that led to her death.  \n\nHowever, recent events have put Kelso to a difficult position, where she learned that Lau and Schaeffer were helping the Division the whole time and trying to prove Lau's innocence to a lot of people. In ''[[Vanguard]],'' she went missing when she followed the trail that led her to Keener and Theo Parnell.  \n\nAfter being shown the truth from both of them, Kelso joined with them and escaped New York via a van after Keener recovered a Mobile SHD Server, with their destination set for their Washington, D.C. to parley with the Division. Her partnership with them marked her as Rogue.  \n\nIn ''[[First Rogue]],'' Kelso was forced to separate from her team when they were ambushed by a Black Tusk's \"welcoming party\" after they arrived to the capitol. While the Division managed to locate and secure Keener and Parnell to the White House, Kelso was still in hiding.   \n\nIn ''[[Burden of Truth]]'', as Division agents followed the clues that Kelso scattered across Washington D.C, they uncovered more truth behind Faye Lau, the Cassandra mission, and Bardon Schaeffer.   \n\n==Personality==\nKelso is quiet and watchful. She always takes in her surroundings and assesses the situation with close scrutiny before she acts. When facing danger, her violent, ruthless side comes out. Her usual solution to problems is to blow them up.\n\nOver time, she feels she doesn't belong in D.C. anymore, feeling more like a stranger to the friendly settlements than a [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agent that people can trust. Where in [[New York City|New York]], she feels more at home with the people in [[Haven|Haven Settlement]], including [[Roy Benitez]] and [[Paul Rhodes]].\n\nShe also held a sense of loyalty to her fellow agent [[Faye Lau]], almost looking up to her. Sadly, Lau going [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue]] broke her spirit badly. After Lau's death and the revelation of why she went rogue came to light, Kelso felt a new sense of purpose and now she's driven to finish what Lau started, both for her memory and to see the end of [[Black Tusk]], even if it means getting her hands dirty.\n\n== Biography ==\nAlani Kelso was born and raised on Kauai, in the state of Hawaii. When she was a child, she lived through Hurricane Iniki, and was left without power for several months. She would later speak to Agent Brooks about how Hurricane Iniki would become the reason that she joined the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]].  \n\nShe joined the Army out of high school and would later become one of the first women to complete [[Wikipedia:Ranger_School|U.S. Army Ranger School]], where she demonstrated an aptitude for out-of-the-box solutions and foul play. This made her highly attractive to the [[Wikipedia:Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency]], and for some years she performed covert operations as a paramilitary agent in the [[Wikipedia:Directorate of Operations (CIA)|National Clandestine Service]]. There she acquired a mixed reputation, as some of her superiors found her methods questionable even though she always got the job done. She was eventually recruited by the Division, and she even worked as an instructor before taking on active agent status. \n\nAlong with [[Manny Ortega]], she was one of the characters coordinating the Division's efforts to retake [[Washington, D.C.]], and sometimes assisted agents in the field, and is one of the only surviving Division agents originally assigned to D.C. \n==Events prior to Tom Clancy's The Division 2==\nKelso has met with [[April Kelleher]], whom told her about her experience in Ann Arbor, with [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agent [[Aurelio Diaz]]. Kelso believed her story about the rumored antivirals, since she knows Agent Diaz. Kelso then discussed the matter with Division Coordinator [[Manny Ortega]], highlighting the importance of finding the antiviral for the [[Green Poison]].\n\nKelso and her colleague, Division agent [[Odessa Sawyer]], were ambushed in an alley, with Sawyer injured badly. Fortunately, they were able to fight off the attackers\n\nAfter the [[SHD Network]] went dark, Agent Kelso talked with [[Agent Espinoza]] and he told her that he's going to check the SHD node hidden underneath the [[Jefferson Trade Center]].\n\nKelso received intel on rogue Division agent [[Aaron Keener]] sent by Division agent [[Faye Lau]] in [[New York City]]. She called in Division agent [[Tegan \"Luna\" Silver|Tegan Silver]] to crack Keener's encrypted [[ECHO|ECHOs]] to learn more about him, his intentions and plans. Little did Kelso know Silver was a believer in Keener's cause. Tasking her to decrypt his ECHOs may or may not have pushed her closer to becoming one of Keener's rogue agents. Eventually, Silver became a rogue agent and worked for Keener.\n\nOn one occasion, Kelso argued with Division agent [[Ryan \"Mercury\" Chang|Ryan Chang]] on moving supplies out of [[Washington, D.C.]]. Chang argued that if the [[True Sons]] or the [[Hyenas]] come for the Division and [[Joint Task Force|JTF]], they are going need them. However, Kelso reassured him that the supplies are just a surplus and transport has been arranged to pick them up.\n\n\n==Tom Clancy's The Division 2==\nAfter an agent arrived in [[Washington, D.C.]], Manny Ortega, the local Division Coordinator, sent the agent to the [[Theater Settlement]] to check in with Kelso, since she is the longest serving agent in city, she would know more about the situation. Meanwhile, knowing her former Division agent colleague, now the leader of the [[Theater Settlement]] - [[Odessa Sawyer]], that her daughter, [[Eleanor Sawyer]], has been kidnapped and held in the [[Grand Washington Hotel]], she sneaked inside and rigged their explosives to create a massive distraction while the new agent fights the way through. Eventually, the agent met with Agent Kelso on the hotel's rooftop, they then killed all the [[Hyenas]] and rescued Eleanor. While the agent went to eliminate the backup Hyena forces, Kelso brought Eleanor back to her mother.\n\nAfterwards, the Division agent met with Kelso and Sawyer at the Theater Settlement, with Kelso persuaded Sawyer to take action against the enemy factions in the district, Sawyer reluctantly agreed.\n\nKelso then sent the agent to the depths of [[Jefferson Trade Center]] to reactivate the SHD node and find Division agent [[Agent Espinoza|Espinoza]]. After the agent reactivated the node, one of the Hyena leaders, [[Coyote]], spoke with Agent Kelso in the SHD comms, informing her that she had Agent Espinosa captured, and tried to broker a deal that if the Division backed off from the building, she would release him alive but not well. Kelso ignored the deal and told the agent to push through and save Espinoza since she believed Coyote would keep him alive to negotiate. However, when the agent reached Espinoza, Coyote killed him in front of the agent. Kelso then told the agent to avenge him.\n\nSometime later, Kelso told the agent to check in with her at the [[Castle Settlement]], only to find out the settlement has been demolished by the [[True Sons]]. Kelso found 7 survivors remaining, hidden in the bunker below the settlement. After the agent arrived, Kelso sent the agent to [[Jefferson Plaza]], where the responsible True Sons were located, and told the agent to make them pay.\n\nAfter the Division further expanded to the west, Kelso told the agent to meet with her at the [[Campus Settlement]], and held a meeting with [[Henry Hayes]], persuading him to take action against the enemy factions again. Henry Hayes then told Kelso he didn't have enough manpower to handle it and made a deal that if the Division can help with the [[Outcasts]] aggression in the area, he could offer his help.\n\nAfter rescuing [[President Ellis]] from the Hyenas in the [[Bank Headquarters]], Kelso, the agent, and Ortega met with the president to discuss the antivirals and formulate a plan to take back the [[Capitol Building]] from the True Sons.\n\nTo get valuable intel regarding the Outcasts, the Division organized a campaign to capture the Outcasts chief strategist, [[Harlan Lloyd]], at the [[Potomac Event Center]]. Agent Kelso was sent to capture him while the agent cut off the Outcasts' transportation. During a firefight, Kelso broke her watch and temporarily disabled communications between her and the [[D.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]]. However, Kelso managed to come out on top of them, and briefly regrouped with the agent before she captured Lloyd.\n\nIn the fight for the [[Capitol Building|Capitol]], Kelso was on a [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] helicopter, waiting for the agent to neutralize the True Sons defenses and then extract with the newly retrieved antivirals. Once all the ground-to-air missiles has been disabled, Kelso set down the helicopter, and the agent got the box on board. Before the True Sons could counter-strike them, Kelso extracted the antivirals.\n\nAfter the Division's victory against the True Sons, Kelso, Ortega, and the settlement leaders get together at the White House to celebrate with fireworks all in the meanwhile the [[Black Tusk]] invaded the city.\n\nAfter the Black Tusk invasion has failed, the Division received word on the whereabouts of the Outcasts leader [[Emeline Shaw]]. Kelso guided the agent to the [[Manning National Zoo]] on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. to hunt down and eliminate the threat.\n\nShortly after, Division [[Agent Sanders]] contacted The Division regarding the Black Tusk activity at [[The Pentagon]]. Kelso asked the agent to reach out to Sanders and investigate the activity. After Sanders and the agent found out the Black Tusk was looking for a [[Broad-Spectrum Antiviral|Biofusion Reactor]], they were confused. Kelso stepped in and explained to them what it was and why the Black Tusk wanted it. After the reactor was secured, Kelso congratulated the team on the success.\n\nA United Ironworks employee called [[Zach Young]] contacted Kelso and the Division regarding the True Sons activity on the [[Operation Iron Horse|ironworks ground]]. Fearing that this could be a True Sons' resurrection in Washington, D.C., Kelso dispatched a team of Division agents to eliminate the threat and told Young to go radio silence and hide until the agents arrived. During the operation, Kelso was in close contact with the agents to see what was going on in there. After several threats were eliminated, Young attempted to step in and help the agents, but Kelso warned him that it was too dangerous. The True Sons' leader at the ironworks, [[Morozova]], executed Young in front of the agents. After a moment of grieving, Kelso continued to guide the agents to the final area of the ironworks to stop Morozova from mobilizing the [[Operation Iron Horse|Iron Horse]] to D.C. The agents stood up Morozova and came out on top. Kelso thanked both the agents and Young for saving the White House.\n\n\n==Warlords of New York==\n[[File:Alani_Kelso.png|thumb|right|300px]]\nKelso and the agent were called in to support [[Strategic Homeland Division|the Division]] in [[New York City]] after multiple biological attacks happened. They assaulted the New York City Hall upon arrival. After they eliminated most of the [[Rikers]] presence at the building, Kelso told the agent to move ahead while she took care of the wounded.\n\nKelso and the agent were then called by acting commander of the Division in the Northeast sector, agent [[Faye Lau]], to get to [[Haven]], a civilian settlement in the middle of [[Lower Manhattan]]. Kelso and the agent got there, but the civilians refused to open the gates of Haven to the agents. After a while of negotiation made by Faye Lau with the settlement leader, [[Paul Rhodes]], the civilians finally opened the gates and let the agents in.\n\nKelso was then informed that the perpetrators of the attack were [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Division]] agents [[Aaron Keener]], [[Vivian Conley]], [[Javier Kajika]], [[James Dragov]] and [[Theo Parnell]]. Kelso provided logistics support for the agent during the hunt for Keener's four lieutenants. Eventually the agent defeated Keener's lieutenants and Faye Lau were able to use their Smartwatches to locate Keener at [[Liberty Island]].\n\nAfter Keener's location was revealed, Kelso moved to the ferry terminal to secure transportation but was met by the [[Black Tusk]] forces who attempted to destroy the ferries. The agent then arrived and with Kelso, they prevented the detonation of the last remaining ferry and secured the ferry terminal. They then set off to Liberty Island. However, during the journey, Black Tusk Commander [[Bardon Schaeffer]] ordered the attack on the ferry using the missiles in his hovercraft. The ferry was destroyed but the agents made it to the shore of Liberty Island. Kelso told the agent to go ahead and find Keener while she took her time to get back up to her feet. Kelso attempted to provide logistics support for the agent but their comms were hacked by Keener, who then teased them in their comms. Kelso then ordered a radio silence to prevent Keener from listening in.\n\nEventually, the agent took out the Black Tusk presence on the island who attempted to kill Keener, as well wounding Keener in a fight. Agent Kelso arrived at the docks and cornered Keener. Keener, fatally wounded, used his final breath to activate the [[Rogue Network]]. Kelso saw that Keener was messing with his [[Keener's Watch|smartwatch]], and she then tried to hold Keener's wound and asked him what he did, but Keener refused to answer, simply stating \"[[Manhunt|you have no idea what's coming]],\" and died. Kelso then shot up a signal flare to request transport off the island. Keener's smartwatch suddenly activated, then started broadcasting the live conversation between Schaeffer and Faye Lau, who revealed that she is now a rogue agent.\n\nKelso got back to [[Haven]] and reported to [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] captain [[Roy Benitez]] and [[Paul Rhodes]] that Lau had gone rogue and was working with the Black Tusk. Kelso then told the agent that a pilot will always be ready for the agent should the agent wishes to travel to New York City or Washington, D.C., and she would travel with the agent to provide logistics support.\n\nSometime after, Kelso told the agent that [[The Summit]], a skyscraper in New York City was being occupied by a large enemy presence, and asked the agent to \"clean it up\".\n\n==Manhunt on Rogue Division Agent Cells==\nAfter [[Aaron Keener|Keener]] has been [[Liberty Island|taken down]], it was revealed to The Division that he [[Manhunt: Jupiter|arranged an attack]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and tasked [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Division]] Agent [[Molly \"Jupiter\" Henderson]] to do it. Kelso briefed the agent on the newly discovered rogue agents cell. The agent hunted Henderson across Washington, D.C. and New York City. It was finally revealed that Henderson is in [[Roosevelt Island Manhunt: Jupiter|Roosevelt Island]], the former [[Outcasts]] stronghold. Kelso guided the agent to the island to take down Henderson, which the agent successfully done so and prevented Henderson from distributing her EMP devices to rogue agents across the country.\n\nKelso received words regarding the recent [[Manhunt: Hornet|rogue agents' activities]] to recruit the Outcasts, led by [[Carter \"Hornet\" Leroux]] and his team of Rogue Division Agents. Kelso tasked the agent to track down the rogues and prevent them from getting away with their Outcasts recruits. The agent hunted down all the rogue agents, which led to the location of Leroux in [[Tidal Basin Manhunt: Hornet|Tidal Basin]]. During the assault on the base, Kelso hacked into a decommissioned [[Warhound]] that [[Black Tusk]] left behind. The agent installed the newly discovered [[Trap (Skill)|healing trap]] on it and it helped the agent to withstand the toxicity of the [[Eclipse Virus|Eclipse]] virus long enough to get through the toxic gas. The agent reached Leroux and finished him off for good this time.\n\nKelso was [[Coney Island Amusement Park (Manhunt: Schaeffer)|alerted]] on the rogue network that a new rogue division agents cell led by the notorious BTSU leader [[Bardon Schaeffer]] was surfaced. Kelso asked the agent to take down the rogue cell and located Schaeffer. After Schaeffer's rogue division agents are being taken down, and his location is revealed, Kelso guides the agent to [[Coney Island Amusement Park (Manhunt: Schaeffer)|Coney Island]], Brooklyn to kill Schaeffer. During the hunt, a [[Hunters|Hunter]] surfaced and brutally killed many [[Rikers]]. Since the very same Hunter had appeared and aided on the agent's hunt for Schaeffer's rogue agents, Kelso suspected that the Hunter was also after Schaeffer. To her surprise, the Hunter was actually working for Schaeffer. After the Hunter was taken out, Kelso heard a conversation between Schaeffer and a woman named [[Natalya Sokolova]], and was curious about her identity. The agent eventually defeated Schaeffer, who was critically wounded from the fight but still alive. Kelso ordered for Schaeffer to be retrieved, aiming to get whatever intelligence they can from him and have him stand trial for crimes against the Division.\n\nShortly after the battle for the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]], Kelso, [[Agent Sanders|Sanders]] and their fellow agents discovered Captain [[Captain Lewis|Lewis]]'s corpse and activated a nearby [[ECHO]], discovering that Lewis had sacrificed himself to buy time for [[Manny Ortega|Manny]] to hide with the unconscious Schaffer. Upon locating Manny's location, Kelso and Sanders assisted him in recovering Schaffer as Kelso decided to return to [[Roy Benitez|Benitez]] in [[New York City|New York]], having grown concerned over further instability owing to the crippling of the [[SHD Network]] by Black Tusk forces.\n\n\n== Following a Trail ==\nWhile agents in D.C. focused their efforts in rescuing civilians kidnapped by the Black Tusk, Kelso returned to Haven, hoping to keep things stable in the settlement. During her stay, she picked up a trail that the ANNA AI left her through Faye's watch calling for \"Cassandra\" and to claim her \"prize\".  Not wasting time, she decided to follow the trail, leading her to go missing.\n\nFear and suspicion would arise among the personnel in the White House/Castle settlements due to the revelation that one of the Division agents, [[Brian Johnson|Brian Johnson,]] turned out to be the Recruiter from the Hunter program, forcing Division agents to face the reality that Hunters are among them. After Johnson's defeat, questions were raised whether Kelso could be trusted. Under Manny's orders, Division agents were sent to investigate Kelso's whereabouts.\n\nDuring their investigation, they learned about a few things. But more importantly, they discovered a camera footage of Agent Kelso in a safehouse with an ECHO left by Aaron Keener. The ECHO reveals that \"Cassandra\" is Faye Lau's secret identity and was secretly working with the rogue agent regarding their Hunter problem. And the solution to that problem could be found inside an SHD crate in that was nearby. However, due to lacking two-factor authentication, Kelso was shocked and was knocked out.\n\nAdditionally, she left a series of notes addressed to the agents attempting to find her out of concern that their comms being intercepted by Black Tusk and the Hunters. Kelso's status was unknown at the time, but it was clear that she's been working on finding an edge against the Black Tusk/Hunters and their technological prowess.\n\n\n== Going Rogue ==\n[[File:Keener Theo Kelso rogue.png|thumb|right|300px]]\nAfter combing through the four areas of Lower Manhattan, Division agents would find Kelso's location pinged on the Stranded Tanker. While they were intercepting her location, they fought and eliminated waves of Black Tusk and True Sons forces, including a Hunter sent by [[Natalya Sokolova]], who were under orders to capture \"Cassandra\". \n\nEntering the tanker and hoping to find Kelso, they instead intercept a SHD crate (the same crate that Kelso found in the safehouse). Similar to what happened to Kelso, their attempt to open it shocks them and knocks them out. Using this opportunity, Aaron Keener (supposedly returned from the dead) cloned the [[ANNA]] system to his watch, opening the crate and taking the briefcase with him. Alongside [[Theo Parnell]] and Kelso, they escaped New York City through a van.\n\nIt's highly probable that after Kelso was knocked out by the SHD Crate from that footage, she was intercepted by Keener who managed to convince her to work with him and Parnell in order to take the fight against the Black Tusk and the Hunters. In any case, after the events at the tanker, she sent a fifth and final note to the agents, apologizing for not telling them what's in the crate, as well as explaining that [[Manny Ortega|Manny]] wouldn't understand and try to stop her from continuing to finish what Faye Lau started.\n\n\n== Trials from The First Rogue ==\nNot long after the events of Vanguard, Kelso alongside Aaron Keener and Theo Parnell would make their way to [[Washington, D.C.|D.C]] to parley with the Division and their allies. She vouched for the agents to Keener, though the latter decided to put them to a series of four trials. And once they succeed and get to meet with him, they'd understand the real threat to the Division. Due to Division comms being compromised, Kelso is still radio dark.\n\nWhile the agents were going through the Leto trial, they intercepted comms between Manny Ortega and Mari Singh. Obviously, Manny was upset over Kelso joining Keener and the fact they're making their way to D.C. But he'd quickly realize that Kelso and her new team are after [[DIAMOND]] since Faye's mission while infiltrating Black Tusk was intercepting the AI.\n\nAfter Division agents met with Keener in Federal Emergency Bunker and helped him in disposing Black Tusk hostiles, Keener was allowed entry to the White House to the panic room's detention cell. Comms correspondence between Keener and Manny reveals that those are the terms the latter have given to the rogue agent, and Keener will remain in his cell until he could bring Agent Kelso and have her vet him. \n\nAdditionally, the comms correspondence reveals that once Keener showed her everything, Kelso willingly joined him. And despite not trusting the rogue agent, Manny desperately wants to trust Kelso. And as it would turn out, Kelso also took Cassandra codename that Faye Lau previously held. While the motivation is not explicitly known, it can be gleaned that Kelso wants to honor Faye and vowing herself to finish what she started.\n\nHowever, Division agents were informed by Keener while [[Shades of Red|starting their first mission with him]] that he, Parnell, and Kelso went separate ways after they were ambushed by a Black Tusk \"welcoming party\" when they arrived to Washington, D.C., forcing the agents to reunite his team. \n\nWhile the Division eventually located Parnell and extracted him to the White House, Kelso's exact whereabouts are unknown with the only lead being that she's still in Washington, D.C and is in hiding. \n\n== Burden of Truth ==\nAfter Aaron Keener and Theo Parnell were secured and sent to the White House, Kelso was still at large in Washington, D.C. Aware that she won't just enter the Base of Operations, Manny Ortega coordinated with Division agents to follow Kelso's trail across Washington, D.C., with express orders not to kill her as she was still owed some explanations. Kelso left clues in many areas, with the intel revealing more truth about Faye Lau, the Cassandra mission, and Bardon Schaeffer\n\nWhile the agents were busy recovering the clues across the city, Kelso infilitrated the White House to take Faye Lau's laptop from the basement. With that laptop, President Ellis's smart watch and the Mobile SHD Server in her custody, she concealed them on Roosevelt Island, hoping the agents would learn the truth after they recover thoseitems. After recovering 11 clues, the agents assaulted the island to recover the mobile server which they managed to do after eliminating True Sons forces in the area. As they recovered the three clues, they play an ECHO where they'd learn a shocking revelation; President Ellis willingly helped Faye Lau by cloning his security clerance for The Ark Protocol to her smart-watch and wiped it on his end, as he didn't want to give the access to Natalya Sokolova. And Kelso has Lau's smart-watch with her.\n\nAround the same time, Kelso infiiltrated her way to the White House's Sick Bay where she lured [[Joshua Summers|Doctor Summers]] (who was a mole for Natalya Sokolova) and killed him, as well as injecting a stim on Schaeffer to wake him up. However, she got intercepted by Manny Ortega, and was gonna be questioned for killing the doctor, which was ignored as Schaeffer woke up from his coma and got helped up by both Kelso and Manny.\n\nWith Kelso secured at the White House and more truth uncovered, the Division have an opportunity to hit Black Tusk where it hurts.\n\n== At the Crossroads ==\nWith Bardon Schaeffer awake and being debriefed by Manny Ortega, Kelso decided to leave the White House and keep a low profile. Given that she has Faye's watch with her, which has the Presidential clearance that Lau was given from Ellis, staying in the White House would put them in danger. She also explained to Manny what the Cassandra mission was, keeping it on the down-low with no comms, wi-fi killers, and EMPs to keep recordings away.\n\nWith that in mind, Kelso is currently in hiding, while Division agents follow through the intel to find their deep-cover asset.\n\n==Equipment==\nKelso is a Rogue [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agent armed with a [[POF P416/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Custom P416 G3]], [[Super 90/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Marine Super 90]] , SHD [[Seeker Mine|Airburst Seeker-Mines]], SHD [[Drone (Skill)|Striker Drones]] and [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Flashbang Grenades]]. \n\n\n==Trivia==\n*Kelso was originally armed with a [[G36/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|G36 Enhanced]] as her primary.\n*Kelso has a cat at her apartment whose status is unknown.\n*As of Year 5 Season 3: Vanguard, Kelso had her design changed from what she was depicted before, sporting a ponytail hairstyle, a black jacket with an orange-black shirt underneath.\n**Later, in Year 6 Season 3: Burden of Truth, Kelso now sports a hooded cloak on top of this design.\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:AlaniKelso Keyart.jpeg|Agent Kelso's new design as seen in Y5S3: Vanguard Key Art\nFile:Y6S1 Story Image.jpeg|Agent Kelso as seen in Y6S1: First Rogue fankit\nKelso manhunt.png\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Other Media==\n=== ''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad''===\n[[File:Alani Kelso 01.png|thumb|130px]]Alani Kelso was featured in ''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad'' as part of the Division faction.

Sworn into office at an undisclosed bunker, he succeeded\u00a0[[President Mendez|Thomas Mendez]], after the latter was murdered by two secret service agents (made to look like suicide). He was on board [[Control Points|Air Force One]] returning to [[Washington, D.C.]], when it was shot down as it was descending to land\u00a0at [[Wikipedia:Joint_Base_Andrews|Andrews AFB]]\u00a0and was listed as K.I.A.\n\nAs The [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] went into the [[Bank Headquarters]] to recover what the [[Hyenas]] stole from Air Force One, it was discovered that Ellis was alive and being held hostage. He was subsequently rescued and returned to [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]].\n\nAs the [[Black Tusk]] invaded [[Washington, D.C.]]\u00a0after the defeat of\u00a0the [[True Sons]], President Ellis disappeared\u00a0without a trace. A discovered\u00a0[[ECHO]] incriminated the President working with [[Bardon Schaeffer]] and the Black Tusk by giving them the [[Broad-Spectrum Antiviral|antivirals]] to cure [[Green Poison]], construed as an act of betrayal against the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]],\u00a0[[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]]\u00a0and the United States of America. Ellis was subsequently declared a traitor to the United States and a manhunt began underway, with his position as President revoked by the United States government.\n\nEllis was eventually assassinated by [[Faye Lau]] at [[Camp White Oak]] during a [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: Faye Lau)|planned meeting between the two.]] Though, later events in ''[[Burden of Truth]]'' would reveal that he was at the very least indirectly involved in the Rogues and their plan to end the Black Tusk's Network.\n== History ==\nBefore Ellis was sworn in as the President, he was originally the Speaker of the House of Representatives. He was a potential contender in the next Presidential election but decided not to run. In the\u00a0[[Grand Washington Hotel]], a poster on a wall\u00a0reveals that Ellis is part of a pro-Private Military Contractor group and was due to attend a conference with [[Charles Bliss|Lt. Col. Charles Bliss]] of the [[Last Man Battalion]] as a guest speaker.\n\nDuring the initial [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] of [[Green Poison]], Ellis\u00a0supported then-[[President Waller]] in activating [[Directive 51]] and dispatching the [[Strategic Homeland Division]] to [[New York City]]. During that time, he was contacted by a mysterious benefactor for an opportunity. \n\nAfter Waller died of a stress-induced heart attack and [[President Mendez]] was sworn in. Ellis was\u00a0evacuated along with the surviving members of the federal government.  \n\nHowever, after President Mendez supposedly committed suicide from\u00a0the stress, Ellis was sworn in from a\u00a0federal emergency bunker in an undisclosed location. Shortly after he was sworn in, he ordered a full retreat of personnel in the Midtown Manhattan Quarantine Zone and the walling off the people who were still inside the zone. The quarantine zone was walled off, eventually becoming the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]]. \n\nHe met with the CEO of [[Black Tusk]] to get briefed on his part of the plan.\u00a0Ellis\u00a0decided to return to [[Washington, D.C.]] as ordered by the Black Tusk's CEO to make sure The Division fell in line and didn't make the job harder for Black Tusk. \n\nAs [[Wikipedia:Air_Force_One|Air Force One]] approached\u00a0it was shot down by a SAM likely under the control of\u00a0the [[True Sons]] and crashed with Ellis on board, it was quickly assumed in the chaos that the President was K.I.A.\n\n\n== Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ==\nAfter receiving information from a [[Hyenas|Hyena]] informant, The Division\u00a0raided the [[Bank Headquarters]] to recover what the Hyenas stole from Air Force One after the crash. Intercepted Hyena transmissions during the raid\u00a0revealed\u00a0President Ellis was still alive and was being held by the Hyenas in the building. The Division quickly found his location and extracts him via helicopter. Ellis then returns to the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]] to continue his position as P.O.T.U.S.\n\nPresident Ellis then called for a meeting with [[Manny Ortega]], [[Alani Kelso]] and\u00a0another agent at The White House, in which he confirms his reasons for returning in that samples of a [[Broad-Spectrum Antiviral|Broad Spectrum Antiviral]] medication were sent to D.C. as a \"continuity of government\" measure and that he knows its location. The medication, according to Ellis, can cure viral infections, which include Dengue Fever, the common cold, and even [[Green Poison]]. \n\nHowever, in order to access the exact location, Ellis requires the briefcase that he was carrying on board Air Force One when it crashed. The Division believes that it is likely\u00a0with the [[True Sons]] at the Capitol\u00a0and Ellis orders them to get it back by any means necessary.\n\nAfter The Division reestablishes\u00a0the [[SHD Network|SHD Satellite Network]], President Ellis gave a speech at The White House, saying that they would kick out the D.C.\u00a0enemy factions, out of their [[Strongholds|castles]] once and for all. The Division soon after\u00a0launched assaults at\u00a0the [[District Union Arena]], [[Roosevelt Island]] and [[Capitol Building]] respectively to do so.\n\nAfter the successful assault on the Capitol Building, the [[True Sons]]' final Stronghold, the briefcase was brought back to the White House. However, as the [[Black Tusk]]\u00a0then invaded D.C., Ellis went missing once again, with no signs of struggle whatsoever.\n\nAfter discovering the location of the\u00a0[[Broad-Spectrum Antiviral|Broad Spectrum Antivirals]]\u00a0at a secret\u00a0laboratory\u00a0under The White House South Lawn, a Division agent discovers the antivirals have already been taken and an [[ECHO]] at the scene reveals that\u00a0President Ellis was working with the [[Black Tusk]] all along and gave\u00a0them the antivirals instead and then requests to use a satellite phone to contact [[Bardon Schaeffer|Bardon Schaeffer's]]\u00a0unknown superior.\n\nThe Division then desperately stormed the Black Tusk's stronghold at the\u00a0[[Tidal Basin]], the location where the antivirals were being stored. They were successful in their assault and the antivirals were retrieved with heavy\u00a0losses to the Black Tusk. However, Ellis was not there and his location was unknown, a manhunt was started to bring him to justice.\n\nAfter defeating Black Tusk at Tidal Basin and\u00a0[[Washington National Airport]], The Division discovers President Ellis's location: [[Camp White Oak]], the Presidential retreat, under heavy guard by Black Tusk forces. A joint Division-JTF assault was mounted on the compound, but President Ellis managed to evacuate in an Air Force helicopter with Marine One markings, with the assistance of BTSU operative [[Ellis Galveston]]. Although he evaded and/or resisted arrest, Schaeffer made a request for his \"clean-up\" crew to cover President Ellis's tracks to ensure that the country is denied of any truth behind his wrongdoings, but The Division wiped-out the \"clean-up\" crew (See [[Camp White Oak (Invaded)]]). Though Ellis's crimes against The Division were concealed, he was later killed by [[Faye Lau]], during a meeting at [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: Faye Lau)|Camp White Oak.]]\n\n=== Truth uncovered ===\nDuring the Division's trail to find Kelso in D.C where they uncover more truth about Faye Lau, Operation Cassandra, and Bardon Schaeffer, they learned that Lau's recruitment by Aaron Keener and his Rogues was for a covert mission where she'd meet President Ellis and gain his access to The Ark Protocol, aka The Football.\n\nBut, there's more. When Division agents followed Kelso's last trail in Roosevelt Island and dealt with the True Sons personnel over there, they recovered Lau's Mobile SHD Server, which allowed them to play a reconstructed ECHO of Lau and Ellis. In that ECHO, it shows Ellis intentionally gave his security clearance to Lau's watch, to prevent Natalya Sokolova from taking control of \"The Football\". And by the end of the ECHO, he tells Lau to finish her mission of killing him, which she gladly followed through.\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter his death, President Ellis is remembered as a traitor for his partnership with the Black Tusk. While the memos he left behind paint a more sympathetic picture, it didn't matter due to the damage he caused. \n\nThroughout propaganda broadcasts manned by Black Tusk, Natalya Sokolova spoke positively of Ellis and his so-called efforts in getting his nation back on track. Those broadcasts are obviously untrue, given she spoke of the President in present tense like he's still alive when he has been dead for a while. It's very likely Nat obscured the truth about Ellis as he was a major part in Black Tusk's plans to be seen as legitimate to the civilian populace, and they're desperate to not let anyone find out. \n\nDuring the events of ''[[First Rogue]]'', while Division agents were completing the trials set up by Aaron Keener, they learned a few things about Ellis from the comms they intercepted. First, they learned that Natalya Sokolova had Ellis stashed with the Hyenas after Air Force One was crashed as a means of proxy war. And secondly, they learn that Keener had [[Tegan \"Luna\" Silver]] leak Ellis' location at Camp White Oak to the Division there'd be more time to deploy the Rogue Network.\n\nAnd in the climax of the events in ''[[Burden of Truth]],'' it was revealed from a reconstructed ECHO that Division agents recovered in Roosevelt Island that he deliberately transferred his Presidential Clearance of \"The Football\" to Lau, to prevent Sokolova from taking control of the nuclear arsenal that the U.S has. This doesn't wash away the horrible actions that Ellis committed, of course, but it did show that in his final moments, he prevented of what could've been a great calamity.\n\n== Personality and Traits ==\nPresident Andrew Ellis was a man of contradictions. He believed himself to be the person the US needed to bring itself back from the Green Poison pandemic as he saw Waller and Mendez as too weak to do what it takes. When Ellis agreed to partner up with Black Tusk, he saw it as a means to rise up to the top and take control. But he'd soon face the sobering reality that he's nothing more than a puppet for Natalya Sokolova in her quest to take control of the country. \n\nAs Bardon Schaeffer put it simply, Andrew Ellis was a Speaker of The House who wanted power, that he made a deal with the devil without realizing the price until it was too late.\n\nThe memos Ellis left behind reveals him lamenting and regreting his alliance with Black Tusk, realizing the damage he caused. In the final entry of his lost memos, he convinced himself to take back control and keeping America safe from Sokolova and Calvin McManus. However, he'd be killed by Faye Lau at Camp White Oak to prevent Nat from finishing her agenda. This left Andrew Ellis as nothing more than a traitor to the people he was supposed to serve.\n\nLater in the climax for ''[[Burden of Truth]],'' it was learned from an ECHO that Division agents recovered from Roosevelt Island, that President Ellis deliberately helped Lau by giving her his Presidential Clearance to prevent Natalya from having it and ordered her to kill him so he wouldn't be forced to do Nat's bidding. Of course, this doesn't undo the mess he made for his partnership with Black Tusk, but it did show that Ellis finally grew a spine and was trying to do something right in his final moments\n\n==Appearances==\n\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:Enemies]]\n[[Category:NPC]]",

All that is known about him is that he joined Calvin McManus's Hunter Program (presumably) sometime before the events of [[Warlords of New York|''Warlords of New York'']].\n\nDuring the events of [[Concealed Agenda]], Deceit was tasked by [[Calvin McManus]] with the mission to observe and stalk [[Faye Lau]]'s operation to recruit more Rogue Agents into the BTSU, as well as to assess whether or not it was worth investing resources into it, leading him to eventually attempt to assassinate these agents, only for his actions to be intervened by [[Strategic Homeland Division|Second Wave Division Agents]] who would end up taking down the targets themselves.\n\nAfter the death of [[Hyenas]] Rogue Agent [[Sueko \"Wraith\" Tanagi]], Bardon Schaeffer called Faye Lau to inform her on her death, explaining that Sokolova had sent him some \"off-the-books\" backup (Deceit himself) to help with the situation regarding his Rogue Agents.\n\nAfter [[Linette \"Dusk\" Edwards]], Rogue Division Agent and [[True Sons]] operative, was taken down by Division agents with the indirect help of Deceit, who was also present on-site with the very same purpose, Bardon Schaeffer was called by [[Lieutenant Chang|Lieutenant Mackenzie Chang]] of the True Sons, who blamed Schaeffer for Dusk's death.  Though Schaeffer argued during the call that 'someone' was hunting Dusk. Later, [[General Anderson]] would end his alliance with the [[Black Tusk]] and start an operation in [[Washington, D.C.]] to investigate said murder.\n\nDeceit, having failed to properly take down his 4 targets (as [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]] managed to do that on their own), was sent to [[Coney Island Amusement Park (Manhunt: Schaeffer)|Coney Island Amusement Park]] to help with Schaeffer's security, as he was to meet with Lau (this was secretly a setup between the two for Schaeffer to be purposefully apprehended by Division agents to brief them on the situation with the Hunters and McManus). There, Deceit would place several explosive traps around the park and constantly taunt the agents, until he was eventually called by Schaeffer and ordered to kill the agents, to which he simply obeyed without question and went on to face the agents in a deadly fight, leading him to his demise.\n\n==Abilities==\nDeceit was armed with a [[AK-47/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Black Market AK-M]], [[T821/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Police T821]], [[Chem Launcher|SHD Firestarter Chem-Launcher]], [[Pulse/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|SHD Jammer Pulse]] and [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|White Phosphorus Grenades]].

Due to not being properly diagnosed on the spectrum, she was known as one of those \"weird kids who's super smart\" in her upbringing. Nevertheless, she became well known as a genius savant, having attended Stanford University at the age of 12. Since graduation, she dedicated her life to creating alternative power solutions and being instrumental in building ODEA Tech with her brother. Moreover, she's known to be a technical genius who's always in need of a challenge.\n\nODEA Tech's work would gather the attention of many defense contractors, including [[Calvin McManus]] and [[Natalya Sokolova]]. On one occasion, Birdie was contracted by Cal to help create stable power solutions for the holograms that are part of [[Descent]] Combat Simulation Program, developed by [[Ortiz Robotics]]. Claire Ortiz refused at first due to not wanting to work with Vikram, but she accepted after being informed that she'll work with Birdie. Furthermore, she worked on stabilizing power systems for underground bunkers meant for United States officials and high-value individuals with ties to the government. One such bunker was occupied by the Ortiz Couple when the [[Green Poison]] outbreak hit the United States.\n\nIn the months after the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]], Birdie was contracted to do work for both McManus and Sokolova when need be. For McManus, she worked on creating autonomous power systems for bunkers that are custom-built depending on the region. During her time with [[Black Tusk]], she felt the need for a challenge as maintaining bunkers occupied by the organization got boring. As such, she asked Sokolova for a couple of modifications to the simulation that Claire was working on by evolving the area of effect and giving dummies live rounds. Sokolova agreed, then showed the technician blueprint schematics of what possibly may be an underground city built to support as many people as possible.\n\n\n\n== Year 5 Season 2: Puppeteers ==\nAfter Vikram was rescued by [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents from Black Tusk's custody a second time, he asked the agents to go and rescue his sister, who was being held at [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: The Recruiter)|Camp White Oak]]. During the fighting, Birdie was contacted by [[Manny Ortega]] and Vikram, who clarify that the Division were sent to rescue her. However, the two got puzzled when they learned that Birdie was informed by Sokolova that Black Tusk and the Division are \"allies\" now. Furthermore, she informs them of a Division agent who sent her to White Oak, describing him as someone who looks like a park ranger.\n\nRegardless, agents make contact with Birdie at the Lake House. With revelation that Agent [[Brian Johnson|Johnson]] is The Recruiter and having the [[Mobile SHD Server]] in his hands, she decided to aid the Division by hacking the Black Tusk mortar systems and turning it against them. Agents face off Johnson, though he'd prove a challenge to them due to his [[Drone (Skill)|Defender Drone]]. Therefore, Birdie used the countermeasure to disable the [[SHD Tech]] for both the agents and Johnson. Despite making a dent to the [[Hunters|Hunter]], he still managed to survive, forcing Birdie to use the mortars against him. With The Recruiter dead, the Division managed to secure the server.\n\n{{Quote|What kind of dog and pony show they are running here. This machine is a thing of beauty. I don't know what the hell Mari did to her, but she needs to get back to the fish farm. Are those scales on the controls? Gross. Don't worry, I can't fix her up.|Birdie to the Agents}}\n\nBirdie was sent to the [[Castle Settlement]], reuniting with Vikram. Despite being casual about her captivity, Vik was glad to see his <nowiki>'sister' alive and well. She was later debriefed by Manny, asking her what Sokolova wanted with the Mobile SHD Server. She explained that Nat wanted the server to modify Black Tusk's tech. When asked by Manny if it's possible, she explained that with the right code and right coder, anything is possible. Given her profession, she didn't give the ''right code''</nowiki> to Nat as something like that requires a professional coder like [[Candice Wallace|Wally]], Claire, or [[Maira Kanhai|Maira]]. \n\nBirdie got briefed with Manny about Black Tusk's HQ and its security systems given she was often sent there to fix the problems they had like getting the AC back up and running, especially given the bunkers were not built below ground and above the water table, causing structural issues. She explained that she was often accompanied by one of Nat's inner circles like [[Dolores Jones]], [[Jack Bonney]], [[Ellis Galveston]], and [[Bardon Schaeffer]]. Though for the last few months, it was only Bonney who was escorting her. Moreover, she explained the HQ's security systems are only accessed by a biometric lock which is unlocked by hand, retinal, biorhythm, and voice confirmation at the same time. \n\nBirdie got settled in well in the Castle, as she and Vik worked in stabilizing the settlement's power grid.\n\n\n\n== Afterwards ==\nLater after the events of ''[[Puppeteers (Year 5 Season 2)|Puppeteers]]'', Birdie was asked by [[Manny Ortega|Manny]] as he was confused how [[Black Tusk]]'s communication systems is the same as the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]]'s. She explained to him that they're both fundamentally in the same network, likening it as both working in the same place. While Manny is grateful that means intercepting Black Tusk's plans, Birdie mentioned that [[Natalya Sokolova]] was aware of the exploit and has been working on fixing it, even though it'd take a lot of server power, so she had Birdie fix the problem.\n\nWhen asked by Manny if she worked on the fix, Birdie admitted it, as she initially thought she was working for him. But she was manipulated by Agent [[Brian Johnson|Johnson]] as he told her what she's working on would get rid of the [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogues]] plaguing the Division and wasn't aware that the Division and [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] were rogues the whole time. While Manny protests the notion, Birdie strictly believes that to be the case since as the Division are fighting Black Tusk and [[Calvin McManus]] is working with them. So in her eyes, as long Cal is in charge, they're rogues.\n\nBirdie was also asked by Manny regarding Black Tusk's biometric security systems as he was confused how they work. She explained that [[Claire Ortiz]] went extra steps for the systems, adding biorhythm and voice recognition as they can be unique. But because deepfake tech can get past those, Claire made the systems require the eye, hand, biorhythm, and voice recognition at the same time. However, the security systems aren't completely fool-proof as the wrong key or wrong biorhythm signature can lock a user out. Best-case scenario, someone else resets the security systems and the user gets sent for interrogation. Worst-case scenario, it activates a killswitch, killing the user and everyone around them. \n\nHowever, Birdie maintains that this only happens in high-security locations. For other territories that Black Tusk has control over like a cargo ship, for example; activating the security system the wrong way would give the user a shock or gas treatment.\n\n== Shades of Red ==\nDuring the Division's incursions in the Simulation Program facility to gather intel from NSA databases, they learned that Birdie was considered for recruitment for Aaron Keener's settlement. However, Keener's friend; Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas, recommended against that. Arguing that despite being brilliant, Birdie is notorius for having no filter and her adopted brother Vikram is a well-known dick. Furthermore, Natalya Sokolova values Birdie's expertise and would never lose tabs on her.\n\nAnd in spite of Birdie being sent to the Castle Settlement after her rescue, Douglas believes it's only a matter of time before Nat tries to take her back.\n\n== Personality ==\nDue to being on the spectrum, Birdie became a genius savant who's able to fix problems on the fly. Her work in creating alternative power solutions at ODEA Tech made her well known in the tech sector. Some folks find her eccentric, as they thought her work ethic doesn't make sense.\n\nBirdie get easily bored when she finds her work no longer exciting and is in need of a challenge, as was the case when she asked Natalya Sokolova to do tweaks on Claire's simulation program to stave off the boredom of maintaining the Black Tusk bunkers.\n\nSimilar to her brother, Vikram, Birdie has a cocky attitude. During the Division's fight against The Recruiter, she took delight in using Black Tusk's countermeasure to disable their SHD Tech, even mocking Recrutier's dogma to \"the mission\".\n\nHowever, Birdie seems to have somewhat of a lack of appreciation towards human life. When she decided to assist the Division in White Oak, she took over Black Tusk's mortar systems, not caring of the collateral damage. Moreover, when she was asked by Manny regarding Black Tusk's Biometric security systems, she found amusement in how the failsafes against false access (like gas or shock, as an example) affect the person.\n== Trivia ==\n* As confirmed by Massive, Birdie is on the Autism Spectrum.<ref>Celebrating Neurodiversity: Autism Representation in The Division 2.

Aquarium. This time, the objective isn't to take out the target - it's to rescue the civilians that Natalya Sokolova and the Black Tusk have taken hostage. Players will need to continue rebuilding the Castle Settlement, which Singh had been using as her headquarters, and every person players rescue will unlock more of the story.\n\n== Manhunt ==\nIn the aftermath of [[Take Back the White House|the White House's attack]] by the [[Black Tusk]], Division agents set out to rescue civilians that were kidnapped by the Black Tusk with the assistance from [[Candice Wallace|Wally]]. This included the first batch of kidnapped civilians: [[John Yazzie]], [[Eva Garcia]], [[Lauren Fong]], [[Mitchell Billings]], and lastly, [[Mari Singh]]. Manny's pregnant girlfriend.\n\nNot long after rescuing Yazzie, Garcia, Fong, and Billings and sending them to the [[Castle Settlement|Castle settlement]], agents managed to pinpoint Mari's location in [[Manning National Zoo (Save: Mari Singh)|Manning National Zoo]]. After fierce fighting against Black Tusk forces, Mari was rescued by the Division and sent back to the Castle. From there, it is revealed that [[Natalya Sokolova]] was deliberately kidnapping the civilians in order to give herself and the Black Tusk legitimacy to take power over the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]] and be installed as rulers of the United States. And in order to put a stop to Soklova's plans, they need to rescue [[Vikram Malik]] from his custody. Unbeknownst to Manny and his allies, a Black Tusk drone was reconning the Castle Settlement, with one of the Black Tusk soldiers revealing to Sokolova that their asset is in their place and awaits her orders.\n\nIn addition to the rescue efforts, Agents discovered an underground NSA facility that houses an [[Descent|Augmented-Reality combat simulation program]] used to test the limits of [[Ortiz Robotics]] tech. Stripped of their gear and SHD tech, Agents participated in simulated combat against simulated enemies from various factions, which included facing the [[NEMESIS|Nemesis]]. With the assistance from Wally, they uncovered audio logs from the NSA's database, going over the history of Ortiz Robotics and their link with [[Calvin McManus]], Natalya Sokolova, The Division, Black Tusk, [[ISAC]], and [[ANNA]].\n\n== Leagues ==\n\n== Comms ==\n\n== Global Events ==\n\n== Seasonal Rewards ==\nThe optional Season Pass is available for 1000 Premium Credits ($9.99 or your regional equivalent) in the in-game store, granting additional cosmetics and opportunities for season gear as you progress.

He was formally introduced during [[Hidden Alliance]] through one of the obtainable audio logs, in which he holds a short conversation with [[Black Tusk]] CEO, [[Natalya Sokolova]]. In an audio log obtain from Descent Comms, He also held a Supervisory role in the development of SHD under DHS, whether or not he created SHD depends on when he was made secretary of DHS and when DHS started the creation of SHD.\n\nMore information about Calvin McManus was uncovered through many intel recovered from [[National Security Agency|NSA]] servers in the [[Descent|Descent Combat Simulation Program]] when Descent mode was released as well as comms from ''[[Puppeteers (Year 5 Season 2)|Y5S2: Puppeteers]]'' and ''[[First Rogue|Y6S1: First Rogue]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nAs of time of writing, the story of this man is unknown. However, it can be assumed that at some point in their life he stepped into the political scenario of the United States and gained enough influence to be appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security, and therefore member of the Cabinet of the United States, much likely having established contact with President [[President Waller|Waller]], who would have appointed him personally before the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]].\n\nMcManus was heavily involved in the various projects that [[Ortiz Robotics]] developed, as he and [[Natalya Sokolova]] were interested parties. He helped [[Claire Ortiz]] in developing the Combat Simulation Program using an underground [[National Security Agency|NSA]] bunker to make it inconspicuous. Furthermore, he was impressed by how [[Mobile SHD Server|Mobile SHD Servers]] performed in the simulation as he was skeptical of them at first.\n\nAdditionally, he requested Ortiz Robotics to develop a backdoor protocol so his specialized [[Smart Watch]] can keep an eye on organizations using [[ISAC]], [[ANNA]], and [[DIAMOND]]. This protocol was to be used by his [[Hunters]] as well. At some point, McManus contracted [[Vikram Malik]] and his sister [[Birdie Malik|Birdie]] to build autonomous power systems for bunkers that are custom-built depending on the region. Those bunkers would happen to be used as bases for his Hunters.\n\nMcManus was prodded over and over by an NSA analyst about the threat that [[Gordon Amherst]] posed, but he refused to take the matter seriously, which allowed Amherst unleashed his [[Green Poison]]. While this could be seen as criminal negligence, it can be concluded that McManus looked the other way as certain elements in the United States government supported Amherst's plans and saw them as means to power.\n\nThrough unknown means, McManus became the one in charge of the secret \"[[Hunters|Hunter Program]]\", responsible for selecting suitable operators and training them to become Wolves/Hunters as watch dogs. At some point, he formed a secret alliance with Natalya Sokolova, where the two could often times borrow \"resources\" (operatives) from one another to use in their operations. \n\nShortly after [[Brian Johnson]]'s arrival to [[Washington, D.C.]], the agent met with McManus after he mysteriously disappeared. Because of Johnson's association with the secretary in the past and his loyalty to Cal's ideals, McManus recruited him into the Hunter program. \n\nWhen [[Bardon Schaeffer]] was having trouble handling his team of [[Rogue Division Agents]] (because of their distance and their difficult relationship), Sokolova contacted Calvin request for support, to which he sent the \"[[Deceit]]\" Hunter to \"clean up the mess\" (assassinate [[Marley \"Shade\" Yarrow|Shade]], [[Sueko \"Wraith\" Tanagi|Wraith]], [[Linette \"Dusk\" Edwards|Dusk]] and [[Skyler \"Belfry\" Williams|Belfry]]). Calvin also asked if she trusted [[Faye Lau]] with their operations, with Sokolova saying she didn't, but Faye didn't really give her a reason not to, so she's fine for the time being. \n\nThe Hunter sent by Cal to kill Schaeffer's rogues had the unwilling help of a [[Division Agents|Division Agent]], who was also hunting them down at the time. When said agent discovered Schaeffer's whereabouts at [[Coney Island Amusement Park (Manhunt: Schaeffer)|Coney Island]], the Hunter was dispatched there to protect him, as well as to kill the group of [[Rikers]] present there as to prevent any witnesses. After both having faced the Rikers, the Agent and the Hunter engaged each other in a 1 versus 1 combat, with the Division Agent managing to kill the Hunter operative after a very tough battle. Schaeffer would then be put into a coma and apprehended by said Agent.\n\nThe next day, Calvin would be contacted again by Natalya, this time, to thank him for the support (sending the Hunter). In turn, Calvin explains that his Hunter Program is hard to find suitable new recruits for, and because he lost one of his men the previous night at Coney Island, he wanted her to send one of her Black Tusk operators as a replacement for his deceased Hunter. Natalya lists [[Felix \"Kestrel\" Sokolov|Felix Sokolov]] (her own brother), [[Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas|Bridgette Douglas]], [[Dustin \"Magnus\" Xavier|Dustin Xavier]], [[Alicia \"Circe\" Coswald|Alicia Coswald]] and [[Jack Bonney]] (despite his very young age) as potential candidates for the Hunter Program, with McManus choosing Bonney as their new recruit.\n\nAfter that event, McManus tasked Brian Johnson to be The Recruiter to train and observe potential recruits for the Hunter program. Later, he presented The Recruiter to Natalya and requested her to have her [[Black Tusk]] refer to him by that moniker.\n\nSometime later, Bonney would start his initiation into the Hunters, receiving a special [[Smart Watch|SHD Smart Watch]] with \"Classified\" Agent Status, as well as a Brian Johnson (simply referred to as \"The Recruiter\"), who watching and observing  Bonney to see if he was suitable for the unit. Bonney would later be killed by the very same Division Agent at [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center]] during one of his \"training sessions\".\n\nPrior to the [[Cleaners]] attack on [[Paradise Lost|Meret Estate]], the high-ranking commander Wright asked Sokolova for a loan of [[SHD Tech]] from McManus to his colleagues \"[[The Lovebirds]]\" and to avoid any suspicion. Calvin agreed to loan some of the SHD Tech to the Cleaners, giving a convenient cover story. Despite the attempt, a team of four Division agents were sent and managed to secure the estate and eliminate the Cleaners, as well securing intel that implicates Sokolova's involvement in the attack.  \n\nWhen the Division rescued four more civilians from Black Tusk and set their eyes on The Recruiter, they'd learn that he's one of their own. Despite the tough fight, they succeeded in eliminating the Hunter before he could extract with the Mobile SHD Server. Cal wasn't heard, but Sokolova did mention that he'd very disappointed at The Recruiter's demise, especially given the Hunter was a special project of his.  \n\nAs revealed in the Descent comms in ''[[First Rogue]]'', McManus activated a Hunter cell several months ago to go to [redacted] to set up Forward Operating Base over there and secure the roster from the SHD database in the bunker. Agent Zabala, one of his Hunters, informed Cal that Agent [[Melanie Hoskins]] is in [redacted]. McManus deduced that Hoskins has been manipulated by Aaron Keener and that he's after the Hunters roster. He demanded Zabala to wipe the roster off the database and secure it in a flash drive.   \n\nIn the conclusion of ''First Rogue,'' after Aaron Keener was allowed entry to the White House in incarceration as per Manny Ortega's terms, Keener shared a bit more intel about McManus. There, it is revealed that McManus is an associate of a powerful shadow organization called The Cabal. Despite Cal's aspirations to become a member, he lacks the money and legacy.  \n\nNot much has been heard from Calvin McManus. But given the losses that his Hunter Program had suffered at the hands of Division Agents, as well as the Recruier, there is no doubt that he's willing to do whatever it takes to end those \"Rogue\" agents once and for all.  \n== Trivia ==\n* Through acquiring the [[Descent]] comms, it is revealed that McManus wears a unique [[Smart Watch|SHD Smartwatch]] with access to all three operational systems, including [[ISAC]] (used by the [[Strategic Homeland Division]]), [[ANNA]] (adopted by the [[Aaron Keener]]'s [[Rogue Network]]) and [[DIAMOND]] (used by the [[Black Tusk]]). His watch also does not include a brick to go along with it, as Cal finds it way too bulky to wear.\n** Curiously enough, in a different comm, it's revealed that his watch would initially change colors upon switching from one AI system to another, but this functionality was later removed in favor of a single color because Calvin felt uncomfortable being called a \"disco ball\" by someone once.\n*Throughout a number of comms, McManus prefers to be called Cal rather than sir or Secretary.\n*In real-world U.S. government structure, the NCC would typically be a high-ranking official within FEMA or DHS, ensuring that continuity of operations (COOP) and continuity of government (COG) plans are executed when needed.\n**While The Division games do not explicitly name a National Continuity Coordinator, the role would likely fall under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or another high-ranking government office. Given that Calvin McManus was appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security by President Waller, he might have had some involvement in continuity planning, but the direct authority over SHD activation remained with the President.\n*It is implied from the Descent Comms that Calvin had a hand in the creation of the SHD with the ussage of funding it, with the covert Black Budget estimated to be 80 Billion per year as it was implied in the 2019 \u2013 The World of Tom Clancy's The Division.\n\n== Missions ==\n* [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center Manhunt: Captain Lewis]] (Mentioned Only)\n* [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: The Recruiter)|Camp White Oak: The Recruiter]] (Mentioned Only)\n\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:Enemies]]\n[[Category:Black Tusk]]",

As of Year 5 Season 2 Puppeteers, she's stationed at the Castle Settlement. In the past months (in-game wise), McAllister used to be stationed at the White House, operating drones to alert agents of surrounding and incoming enemies. \n== Profile ==\nCindy McAllister grew up in a military family. The youngest of six, with 5 older brothers, Cindy was one of the boys and an avid gamer. She enlisted in the Army, and ended up in the National Guard as a drone pilot. When the crisis hit, she joined the JTF and, due to her excellence, she was recruited by the Division. \n\nAfter helping to recover Tchernenko and the bioreactor, Cindy took a step back from active duty. She found herself making questionable choices to get the job done, and focused on reconnaissance, intel, and security support. Manny pushed for her to help with the Castle and build a sense of community and relationships with the people there. He thought that getting her out of her digital world might help her regain her humanity. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nWhen the Division agents set their sights against enemy factions in [[Washington, D.C.]], McAllister helped the agent scouting threats at different locations, and alert the agent of enemy presences and ambushes alike.\n\nDuring the Russian scientist [[Vitaly Tchernenko]]'s resurface on [[Coney Island Ballpark|Coney Island]], McAllister used a remote drone to work with the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agent and coordinate the JTF forces on Coney Island to locate and extract him. When the [[Black Tusk]] resisted, McAllister helped hacking into the mortars and turn it against them. \n\nAfter Division agents successfully extracted Tchernenko, McAllister located the remaining Black Tusk forces on the [[Coney Island Amusement Park]] that are being assaulted by the [[Cleaners]]. She guided the agent to the amusement park area of the island and to clear all hostile factions on the island. After the agent killed all the remaining forces, her drone was hacked by rogue agent [[Aaron Keener]]. \n\nBefore the drone was destroyed, Keener sent his message to the agent, claiming that he is always and will be one step ahead of them. McAllister wasn't happy about the fact that she and the SHD agents were manipulated by Keener, but nonetheless thankful that she did her part helping the agents. \n\n{{Clear}}\n== Relief of Duty and Kidnapping ==\nAfter the events at Coney Island, McAllister was questioned by [[Manny Ortega]] for her actions, fearing that she's spending too much time operating Drones and not enough time with people. She was relieved of her duty and attended a therapy session with Dr. [[Mitchell Billings]], venting her frustration about her state of mind. Not long after, she'd be sent to The Castle settlement to help with farming. \n\nAgent Kelso was not happy about this state of affairs, as she saw McAllister very valuable as a drone operator. Nevertheless, McAllister struck a friendship with Jack and Mel Arnold as well as Vikram, even though they make jokes at his expense. McAllister was also introduced to [[Candice Wallace|Candice \"Wally\" Wallace]] and got to know her, even asking her for asssitance in decrypting an encrypted file she recovered from a Hunter Drone. \n\nLater on, Cindy was kidnapped alongside [[Mel Arnold|Mel]]/[[Jack Arnold]], [[Vikram Malik]] and other civilians by the Black Tusk forces during their attack on the White House. \n\n\n\n== Rescue and Finding Peace ==\nAfter the [[Brian Johnson|Recruiter]] made his presence known, McAllister was found at the [[Air & Space Museum: Save Cindy McAllister|Air & Space Museum]], held hostage by [[Black Tusk]] and [[True Sons]] when the Division agents finished combing through the East Mall area. The agents intercepted her location, and eliminatied their enemies so their allies could rescue McAllister. \n\nAfter her rescue, she was sent to [[The Castle]] settlement, and was debriefed by Manny subsequently asked to help Wally with issues that the Mobile SHD Server suffered at the time.  McAllister continues working in the settlement as a recruiter for [[Civilian Militia|civilian militia]] and doing her part a farmer. While it's not the same as her former occupation, Cindy would find some measure of peace doing her part in helping and socializing with people. \n\n== Possible Candidate ==\nCindy McAllister was one of the candidates for Aaron Keener's settlement, which the Divison learned during their incursions in the Descent simulation facility while gathering intel from NSA Databases. Keener saw an opportunity with the former dorne operator, due to the fact that McAllister took over Black Tusk's mortar systems during the events at Coney Island and enjoyed using their mortars against them.\n\nHowever, Bridgette Douglas mentions that thanks to Manny Ortega, McAllister is in therapy and grounded. Keener got a bit frustrated, claiming that Manny doesn't know how to spot talent, but Douglas argues that Manny doesn't to encourage people's bad behaviors. Keener, on the other hand, sees bad behaviors as necessary skillsets, even commenting \"Rogue agent potential\". Douglas protests that McAllister is not an agent, she's a normal person, which led to Keener commenting that all Division agents were normal people before their activation. Douglas argues she was never normal, which made Keener comment that not every agent was born with a golden bullet in the chamber.\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 3539.jpeg\nFile:Target Cindy 16x9 FB.jpeg\nFile:Iy0usswtnorccelkz5j4.png|Cindy typing on her computer at [[the White House]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n\n[[Category:NPC]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:People]]",

She and her husband, Alexander, founded [[Ortiz Robotics]], where they worked with [[DARPA]] in developing cutting-edge military hardware and AI for the U.S Government and their corporate interests. She's also the brainchild behind [[ANNA]] and the [[Descent|Descent Combat Simulation Program.]]\n\nHer time working in Ortiz Robotics and her partnership with [[Calvin McManus]] and [[Natalya Sokolova]] forms the basis of [[Comms/Descent|Descent comms]] throughout Year 5.\n\n== Biography ==\nNot much is known about Claire's upbringing or studies. But what from can be inferred from comms recovered from the NSA servers in the [[Descent]] simulation, Claire and Alex met, got married, and later established their own company, [[Ortiz Robotics]], with a focus on engineering and robotics design. \n\nDuring the early days of the company, Claire designed [[ANNA]] as an in-house assistant AI for the company. While Alexander liked it, he was apprehensive about the human-like behavior that ANNA displayed. Over time, the company has been contracted by the U.S government to help develop cutting-edge military hardware with the help of DARPA. At some point, Claire and Alex pitched ANNA to two interested parties: [[Calvin McManus]] and [[Natalya Sokolova]]. However, neither of them favored the AI. So, Claire and her husband worked on two off-shoots: [[ISAC]] for Cal to be used in the NSA (National Security Agency) and his newly-minted [[Strategic Homeland Division]]. [[DIAMOND]] as a critical backbone system for Natalya's [[Black Tusk]].\n\nAt one point, Claire and Alex was requested by Calvin McManus to create a unique [[Smart Watch]] that allows Cal access to all three AI systems - ANNA, ISAC, and DIAMOND. While they designed the backdoor protocol necessary to make it happen, Claire was concerned about the security risks. \n\nClaire was involved when [[Vivian Conley]], who worked in Ortiz Robotics briefly as a contractor, presented several design proposals based on incendiary munitions. Those proposals were refused due to impracticality and ethical concerns, which led to Vivian being dismissed when her contract ended. But because Ortiz Robotics had intellectual rights to Conley's work, her design ideas were used without credit like the [[Turret#Mod: Dragonbreath|Dragonbreath]]/[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2#Incinerator Turret|Incendiary Turret]] and the Ortiz: {{Gearset|Exuro Gear Set}}.\n\nClaire designed to have ANNA as the handler for the [[Warhound|Warhounds]], however that was shut down when Nat demanded no talking AI. Claire was also involved with Alex in mobility experiments for the Warhounds, including the ability to run. However, the experiments were a total failure, forcing Natalya to add additional funding to redesign her Warhounds. During the redesign, Claire added [[SHD Tech]] integration to allow Warhounds be smarter, though she kept it secret from Nat by telling her its pulse mapping. When Cal shut down Alex's proposal to have warhounds inserted with embedded Division agents, Claire asked him if he needed his agents to take control of Natalya's Warhounds if necessary, Cal answered by only allowing his agents that have [[Hunters|classified clearance]].\n\nGiven the fact that many of the projects Ortiz Robotics have developed were to be used for SHD agents from different walks of life, Claire worked on an AR combat simulation program to test an operator's effectiveness in combat. She also developed suits that can assess an operator's mental and physical effectiveness as well as allowing them to feel pain while participating in the program. In Claire's perspective, she sees operators in a combat situation can react in different ways while sustaining injuries. The program was almost entirely funded from Nat, under the pretense of building an environment to test her Warhounds in combat against real-life \"volunteers\". The program was developed in an underground NSA Bunker in [[Washington, D.C.]] which was used previously to field test many projects that Ortiz Robotics developed like the [[Turret/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Turret]] and [[Chem Launcher]].\n\nThe program worked initially, but there was power stability problems with the holograms, so ODEA Tech was contracted to procure a stable power solution. Claire was apprehensive about this as she didn't want to work with [[Vikram Malik]], but was grateful when Cal reassured her that she'd work with Vik's sister: [[Birdie Malik|Birdie]].\n\nDuring one of the field tests from the simulation, Claire observed [[Brian Johnson]] and his effectiveness in passing through the simulation. However, Cal needed more feedback, so Claire sent a simulated .50 cal round to Johnson, making him feel immense pain. This pleased Claire as it gave her much needed feedback. Claire was also involved in designing [[Mobile SHD Server|Mobile SHD Servers]], which play a critical part for the [[SHD Network]]. She had them designed as an insurance policy against potential coup as she did not trust Natalya. Cal was impressed, seeing her as a true patriot.\n\nEventually, ISAC was chosen to be the AI handler for the Division due to multiple negative feedbacks from field agents against ANNA during the tests. Orders came up to have ANNA shut down. Vivian was enraged and begged Claire to not let them kill ANNA. Claire reassured her that ANNA is kept safe beneath ISAC's code in the Mobile SHD Server.\n\nWhen the [[Green Poison]] broke out, Claire and Alex got to a bunker to stay safe from the effects of the virus and weather out from the chaos of the outbreak. A bit after the activation of First Wave agents in [[New York City|New York]], Claire was called up by Cal as he was enraged that a Division agent was accidentally marked [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue]], lost access to SHD Tech, and got killed. Therefore, she made a workaround by allowing rogue agents keeping access to SHD Tech. To compensate, Claire allowed first deployment of the [[Hunters]] as a failsafe against future rogues.\n\nClaire's status in the months after the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] is currnetly unknown.\n\n=== Legacy ===\nWhile the status of Claire and her husband Alex remain unknown, she'd be mentioned a couple of times from various people. At first, she was mentioned by Birdie when she was asked by Manny Ortega if Mobile SHD Servers could be modified.\n\nWhile the conversations between Theo Parnell and Mathias \"Trig\" Schneider were set months before from the current timeline, Claire is mentioned again during their conversation about the security issues with the Network, namely the backdoors and side-doors that could be exploited. When Parnell wondered if that was intentional, \"Trig\" hoped that'd be the case with Claire as he believed those security issues were on purpose, and mentioned that she always had her reasons, even if they don't make sense to anyon else.\n\nGiven recent revelations, it can be inferred that Claire did not trust Natalya Sokolova nor Calvin McManus given their agendas and she had built those backdoors into the Network, probably in hopes that someone smart enough to disrupt the network systems that Sokolova and McManus use from within, considering that direct engagement against these two would be highly dangerous.\n\n=== The Key to The Network ===\nAs the Division uncovered the truth about Faye Lau while following Agent Kelso's trail, they'd learn from a comm they recovered that Claire Ortiz plays an important role in the war against Black Tusk. \n\nBardon Schaeffer corroborates the notion during his debriefing with Manny Ortega, telling him that in order to take down The Diamond Network that powers Black Tusk's tech, they need Claire Ortiz as she's the one who built Ortiz Robotics Network, in which the SHD, Black Tusk, and Rogue networks really on.\n\nHowever, that would depend on whether Claire is still alive.\n\n== Personality ==\nFrom what can be inferred across the comms from [[Descent]], Claire Ortiz could be best described as a breadwinner as her genius and expertise were instrumental in having [[Ortiz Robotics]] contracted to design cutting-edge hardware and Artificial Intelligence for secretive organizations like [[Strategic Homeland Division]] and [[Black Tusk]].\n\nAs the brainchild behind [[ANNA]], she has special fondness for the AI given her advanced code and human-like mannerisms. She hoped by pitching ANNA, there'd be interested parties who'd take the AI. But circumstances were not kind to her nor with ANNA. And despite criticisms against ANNA, Claire was very protective of the AI, even going as far as keeping her safe beneath [[ISAC]]'s code in the [[Mobile SHD Server]].\n\nBecause her work in Ortiz Robotics involved cutting-edge military hardware and AI, Claire may not have the ethical restraint to consider the implications of her work. As an example, one programmer named [[Kevin Park]] became aware of Claire's work for ISAC and attempted to warn people about the security risks and privacy violations the AI represents, only to get intimidated to silence.\n\nWhile Claire doesn't call herself as a patriot, she does care for her country as her work in designing the Mobile SHD Servers is instrumental in keeping the Division's SHD Network safe against their nemesis, Black Tusk. She maintained a belief that some of the projects that Ortiz Robotics developed should belong to the people. \n\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Claire was first mentioned in the quote (which appears to the player after dying from the boss fight) from [[Sparkle]] Warhound in [[Coney Island Ballpark (Manhunt: Stovepipe)|Coney Island Ballpark]]. In that quote, she talks about how the Flamethrower Warhound could revolutionize forest maintenance. Ironically, Sparkle was used for combat than for forest maintenance.\n* As revealed in the official website's article about Neurodivergence in the game, Claire Ortiz is voiced by actress Madison Walsh (who coincidentally voices Birdie Malik)\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:People]]",

It was introduced in [[Broken Wings|Year 5, Season 1: Broken Wings]].\n\n== History==\nThe Descent Facility was originally designed both as a training environment for [[Strategic Homeland Division]] agents, and later a proving ground for [[Ortiz Robotics|Ortiz Robotics']] various engineering projects, including the [[ISAC]] AI and their [[Warhound]] robots. Seeking discretion away from prying eyes, the program was housed in an underground [[National Security Agency|NSA]] Facility in [[Washington, D.C.]]. \n\nParticipants wore specialized telemetric suits that simulated pain to gauge agents' physical and mental limits in combat. Division agents [[Brian Johnson]] and [[Vivian Conley]] participated in early demonstrations of the simulation, which were observed by Secretary of Homeland Security [[Calvin McManus]]. However, Ortiz Robotics developed the program almost entirely using funds from [[Natalya Sokolova]], under the pretense of building an environment to test the effectiveness of her Warhounds in combat against real-life \"volunteers\". \n\nAfter [[Erica Gonzalez]] unwittingly infected an entire NSA Detention Center with [[Green Poison]], McManus and his staff evacuated [[NSA Site B13]] and retreated to the Facility as a temporary quarantine zone.\n\n=== ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'' ===\nMonths after the outbreak, Division agents were rescuing civilians from Black Tusk when they uncovered two entrances to the Descent Facility--one next to the [[Castle Settlement]] and the other east of the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]]. Division agents entered the facility and infiltrated the bunker, facing rooms of simulated hostiles, to extract valuable intel for [[Candice Wallace|Wally]] from the NSA databases detailing the history of the simulation and Ortiz Robotics' connections to The Division and Black Tusk. \n\n== Storyline ==\n''Disclaimer: This section will focus on the story of Descent from its comms in a chronlogical order as possible as the order of comms in-game don't follow the story chronlogically.''\n\nDuring the events of Broken Wings, while Strategic Homeland Division agents were busy finding and rescuing civilians who were kidnapped by Black Tusk, they uncovered two entrances to the Combat Simulation Program facility - one next to the Castle Settlement, and the other east of the White House. Entering the underground facility, the agents were introduced to the simulation program where they fight simulated hostiles room to room, culminating in facing the dangerous Nemesis hostile. And in the process, they extract valuable from the NSA databases. Through that intel, they learn of the secret history behind the simulation, Ortiz Robotics, and their connection to The Division and Black Tusk in Year 5.  By Year 6, the intel the SHD Agents gathers would involve Aaron Keener, his associates, and his activities several months in the past\n\n=== Year 5 ===\n\n==== Early days of Ortiz Robotics/Creation of ANNA ====\nThroughout Year 5, we are introduced to Alexander and Claire Ortiz, the husband-wife team who runs Ortiz Robotics; An enginnering/robotics design company. During the early days of the company, Claire pitched a proof of concept for a fully automated AI named ANNA that can sift through data by itself. When asked by her husband, Alex, how would the AI detect a threat, she mentions by using the algorithim, using keywords and phrases. And when Alex asked what if someone goes to the movies and the AI thinks the action on screen is a real threat, Claire answers by using biometrics and voice recognition where ANNA uses a biometric scan of the speaker to determine if the audio comes from a person or a recording. After a while, Claire showed the first prototype of ANNA, which impressed Alex believing it'd make their company rich. However, Alex felt apprehensive about ANNA's personality, feeling like her personality would be off-putting to operatives when they're alone in the field, though Claire believed that an AI with a personaltiy would make operatives feel less alone. And when asked if they'd grow to hate ANNA, Claire retorted everyone hates their handler, but they'd appreciate having one because they'd be lost without them. \n\nClaire would later request Vivian Conley, who worked in the company as a contractor, to run a pulse scan and map the region for ANNA. It was an unauthorized request, so Claire requested Viv to not tell Alex before ANNA is pitched to Calvin McManus, the Secretary of Homeland Security, with Viv promising her she won't tell them and followed through.\n\n==== Contracted/Backdoor Protocol ====\nOrtiz Robotics was later contracted by Calvin McManus, representing the U.S Department of Defense. And Natalya Sokolova, CEO of Sokolov Concern and Black Tusk. Both individuals were interested in procuring an AI software - McManus, for NSA surveillance and equipping the newly-minted Strategic Homeland Division. And Sokolova, as guidance systems for Black Tusk's warhounds. Both individuals were trying to outbid each other, but Claire made it clear that the company have set the price and Alex clarified that the technology from Ortiz Robotics is not exclusive and would be available to their organization with top of the line security to ensure their data stays secure, remotely accessible, and backed up permanently to a private apocalypse proof server at one of their bases in North Dakota or Alaska. Claire, on the other hand, expressed discomfort at giving too much power to private interests, like Sokolova in this instance.\n\nUnfortunately, neither parties were interested in ANNA. When ANNA was pitched to Sokolova as a voice module and guidance system for the Warhounds, Sokolova found the AI off-putting and insulting, demanding the Ortiz couple no AI at all. Thus, they were forced to make two off-shoots - ISAC, a more binary AI package, and DIAMOND, a system without an AI handler interface. \n\nBecause the projects that Ortiz Robotics worked on (i.e Turrets, chem launcher) were considered to be of questionable legality and ethics, McManus granted them an underground NSA bunker in Washington, D.C to field test their projects.  \n\nAt one point, Cal requested a specialized Smart Watch that could access the three AI systems for himself and other, more obscure teams working for Homeland Security (The Hunter Program). Ortiz Robotics obliged by creating the backdoor protocol, though Claire expressed concerns over the security compromises that protocol would cause. \n\n==== Warhound Mobility Experiments/SHD Tech Integration ====\nDuring the process of designing a guidance system for the Warhounds , Ortiz Robotics attempted mobility experiments for the bots, including running in two legs. While Natalya Sokolova saw the potential, she found the Warhound running in two legs a bit off-putting. Unfortunately, due to legacy coding issues from the bipedal running experiments, it caused the Warhounds to fall on their backs and turtle, and Sokolova was forced to put another huge investment to start from scratch. Eventually, Ortiz Robotics managed to add proper guidance system for the Warhounds via SHD Tech integration, though they bluffed to Sokolova by telling her its pulse mapping.  \n\nAlexander was worried about the bluff, but his wife Claire assured him that Nat is already aware they're all in the same network and that until RnD is finished, it's easier and safer for the Warhounds guidance systems to be built in the same network and they can work on the segregation for later as the quadrupedal bots were years away from deployment. \n\nWhen Alex and Claire presented the Warhounds to McManus, he vehemently refused as his SHD Agents are supposed to be embedded in society and there's no easy way to explain a talking Warhound in a home garage for a SHD Agent embedded as a high school teacher, as an eample he used. When asked by Claire if he needs his agents to have access to the Warhounds should the need arise, Cal answered [[Hunters|only for agents that have classified access]]. \n\n==== Mobile SHD Servers ====\nIn the aftermath of their Warhound presentation, Ortiz Robotics worked on Mobile SHD Servers to be used for rural areas in the United States. When Alex presented it to Calvin McManus, the latter wasn't impressed as all he saw was a briefcase. Furthermore, given that the server was presented in a leather briefcase, it would make it look suspicious to anyone living in the rural areas. As such, Cal requested to change the briefcase to metalic and lose the insignia, in addition to adding the insignia only on the server's loading screen.\n\nAlex and Claire felt Cal's feedback made a lot of sense and went ahead with it. Over time, the Mobile SHD Servers would be field-tested in the combat simulation program and later inserted across many areas in the United States. When informed about this by Alex, Cal felt the insertion of Mobile SHD Servers and ISAC Nodes were a bit overkill, though Alex counters that it's a band-aid and clarifying that Natalya Sokolova wouldn't be ordering so many Warhounds if she wasn't getting ready for war. And if that's the case, SHD agents should get ready too.\n\n==== Vivian Conley laid off and her recruitment to the SHD ====\nVivian Conley worked for Ortiz Robotics for a little while as a contractor. Many of her design proposals were based on incendiary munitions, which were rejected by Alexander and Claire Ortiz due to practicality/ethical issues. At some point, Alex informed her that if she doesn't have a design fit for the company within two months, her contract would not be renewed. At some point, Conley vented her frustrations with an NSA Analyst, feeling that the designs made by Claire and Alex were view more favorbly than her own designs.\n\nIndeed, at the end of her contract, Conley was dismissed. And since many of her design proposals were intellectual rights to Ortiz Robotics, including personal work that she made while she was living in their work campus, it belonged to the company. After being dismissed, Alex requested Conley to give back the Smart Watch she has on her. However,, McManus saw potential in Conley and recruited her to the Strategic Homeland Division. As such, the Smart Watch belonged to Conley. \n\nIronically enough, Conley's work would be used without credit to design the [[Turret|Dragonbreath]]/[[Turret/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Incinerator Turret]] and [[Gear Sets|Ortiz: Exuro Gear Set]]. Despite Alex's notion that her work were only for the field tests when Conley volunteered for the simulation, they'd be later used for Division Agents who were activated during the Green Poison crisis and are still used to this day.\n\n==== Combat Simulation Program/Operator Suit/Power Solutions ====\nConsidering that some of the projects that Ortiz Robotics was working on are to be used by SHD agents who were recruited different walks of life, Claire Ortiz decided to work on developing a combat simulation program using Augmented Reality to test an operator's effectiveness during the stress of combat. Moreover, she worked on developing suits for the simulation to assess the operator's mental and physical effectivness as well as letting them feel pain while participating in the simulation. In her perspective, people sustaining injuries during a combat situation can react in different ways and she wanted to see how those operators would react when in pain. \n\nThe program was almost funded entirely from Sokolova, under the pretense of building an environment to test her Warhounds against real-life \"volunteers\".  The simulation was developed in an underground NSA facility in Washington D.C that was previously used to field test the projects that Ortiz Robotics developed.\n\nThe program worked initially, but there were power stability issues with the holograms. As such, McManus hired [[ODEA Tech]] to develop power solutions. Claire was apprehensive as she didn't want to work with Vikram Malik, but her concerns were assuaged when her husband Alex assured her she'd only work with Vik's adopted sister, [[Birdie Malik|Birdie]]. \n\nBirdie's work proved instrumental in providing power solutions for the simulation, and Claire was thankful to Calvin McManus for hiring her. Furthermore, she informs him that she's working on a [[NEMESIS|program]] that will completely automate the simulation and training for McManus' operatives, and allow Birdie to do her work indepedently, which McManus approved as he's more than happy to inherit any old or surplus toys from Sokolova.\n\n==== Field Tests ====\nField Tests would be conducted on the combat simulation program. In one test, two Division agents; Brian Johnson and Vivian Conley were volunteered to field test the Mobile SHD Server. In another field test, Johnson participated one in the simulation in which he managed to avoid hostile fire. This impressed Calvin McManus, though he felt there's more feedback to be evaluated. As such, an unexpected simulated .50 cal round hit Johnson, which made him feel the pain through his operator suit. Claire was elated by the feedback.\n\nAfter the tests, Cal gave compliments to Claire for the results the Mobile SHD Servers made in the simulation, believing it'll be a game-changer if they're half-effective in real-life compared to the sims. He asks if Sokolova is aware of the Mobile SHD Servers, Claire answered that Nat doesn't know this yet and mentioned the servers are insurance policy against a potential coup. Moreover, Claire also mentions to Cal there'll come a time where he'll need to cut off Nat's access to the Network. \n\nCal remarked that Nat would gladly pay a lot of money for a similar system. Claire expressed that some power should only belong to the people, showing her distrust of Sokolova.\n\n==== ISAC Surveillance/Gordon Amherst ====\nAs part of field tests for ISAC, he was given to the NSA for surveillance. On one occasion, it was used to intercept a South-American Cartel, which an NSA Analyst promised of basic outline of their infrastructure within month. However, the NSA Analyst was uncomfortable over the power that ISAC has, as he surveiled on a college student who was making plans to seduce her professor.  The analyst argued that she didn't join up the agency to breach some people's privacy, but Calvin McManus dismissed her worries that sometimes the job involves spying on people for the sake of national security even if it's not glamorous as spying on a Cartel.\n\nHowever, that professor would happen to be [[Gordon Amherst]] himself. NSA Analyst became aware of his eco-fascist views, leading her to bring her concerns to Cal. Cal, on the other hand, saw Amherst as simply a kook. NSA Analyst became persistent in her surveillance towards the professor, which Cal became aware of, and led him to rant towards the analyst that the only proof she has against Amherst is his ramblings about Climate Change. When NSA Analyst mentions Amherst's association with [[Vitaly Tchernenko]], a virologist who specializes in 3D-Printing, Cal was dismissive about this, but the analyst expressed they should be concerned about grown men who could create a virus using 3D-Printing.\n\nWhen one NSA team was operational in New York, NSA Analyst tried to convince Cal again to make a move towards Amherst. However, Cal brushed off Amherst's potential as a threat, telling her to \"prioritize the tree\", even threatening her to put in a transfer to the Roswell Office. Cal's negligence would prove to be fatal.\n\n==== ANNA's Safety ====\nAt some point, orders came from the top to have ANNA shut down and ISAC was chosen to be the AI handler for the Strategic Homeland Division. This was not surprising as some operatives who had ANNA as their handler during the field tests gave negative feedback as they were antagonistic towards an AI with a female voice \"telling them what to do\". Which Claire Ortiz found it sexist and utterly disgusting.\n\nVivian Conley heard the news about ANNA and was enraged, begging Claire to not let them \"kill\" the AI, as she felt ISAC is not as sophisticated as ANNA, even though the powers that be believed that ISAC was simply ANNA but with a male voice. Claire assuages Vivian's worries, telling her that ANNA is kept safe underneath ISAC's code, and dormant within the Mobile SHD Server.\n\n==== Green Poison Outbreak ====\nDuring the Green Poison outbreak, an asymptomatic carrier; [[Erica Gonzalez]] unwittingly infected the NSA Detention Center in Washington, D.C with Green Poison, after she was captured by the police for another attempt to light a Chirstmas tree on fire. To avoid the spread, Cal and his staff evacuated NSA Site B13 and the Detention Center, then retreated to the underground facility as a temporary quarantine zone.\n\nAfter some time, the NSA Analyst would rant with Vivian Conley (who was being activated as a Division Agent) over Cal's negligence towards Gordon Amherst and feeling the blame not being to stand up against him and take action against Amherst. Despite Vivian assuring her that justice would have its way against Cal, the Analyst was skeptical as she believes that Cal would get away with it and find a way to promote himself. Viv said Cal could get promoted to Secretary of Defense while the Analyst said he could get promoted to President of the United States. Vivian found the notion ridiculous and would rather move to Sweden, expressing that having Cal as POTUS would really be the end of the world.\n\n==== Deployment of the Hunter Protocol ====\nDays after the Division's activation, one Agent was marked Rogue by ISAC due to breaking in a Pharmacy to look for medical supplies for her wounds, which caused her SHD Tech to go offline and got killed as a result. Cal was upset, prompting him to call Claire and Alexander who went to an undisclosed bunker to weather out the Green Poison outbreak and monitor the performance of their technology. During the call, Cal demanded to fix the issue, prompting Claire to reprogram the Smart Watches to give Rogue Agents continued access and functionality for SHD Tech as a precautionary margin of error.\n\nTo compensate, she authorized the deployment of the Hunter Protocol, allowing Cal to activate his Hunters in case Rogue Agents become a problem.\n\n=== Year 6 ===\n\n==== Creation of LINC ====\n[[Kevin Park]], an engineer and programmer, pitched his own concept for an autonomous communications tool called LINC to [[Mathias \"Trig\" Schneider]] while working in DARPA. Trig felt Park's concept was sound, but wanted to see the prototype before going ahead with it. During the conversation, Trig accidently slipped up Claire Ortiz' name when he encouraged Park to talk to an interested party. \n\nLater on, Park presented an upgraded version of LINC to Trig, who was impressed by the upgrades. Trig asked for a full demonstration of its capabilities, technical schematics, and review the code so he could bring the relevant people and have Park's project funded.\n\nAt some point, Kevin Park was at a conference about AI and guidance systems and met Claire. They got to talk, with Park pitching his LINC project. Claire found it adorable, but mentioned it doesn't compare to her AI ISAC. Kevin became worried about the AI and the security risks it could represent, so he approached Trig to talk about it. Kevin wanted to warn people about ISAC, how Claire's work could violate privacy laws. However, Trig intimidated Kevin to silence, threatening him if he talks to anyone about ISAC, he'll be flagged a traitor to the United States and be sent on a \"permanent vacation\" on Guantanamo Bay.\n\n==== Agent Hoskins recruited ====\nAfter the events in [[Tom Clancy's The Division: Hearts on Fire|Hearts on Fire]], Agent Melanie Hoskins was approached by Rogue agent Aaron Keener. He showed her the truth behind what caused the Green Poison, which allowed her to not open fire on him for now. However, Hoskins couldn't trust Keener, so he informed her that he sent a couple of his fellow Rogues to the farm that Hoskins sent her family to during the outbreak and informed her that they're safe as a token of goodwilll. And as an incentive, he'll have some of his people keep the Hoskins farm secure in exchange for Melanie to accept an assignment that would take her to a small town in the middle of nowhere called [Redacted].\n\nHoskins makes it to [Redacted], which she finds it to a warzone with only a small resistance. As per her assignment, she makes it to a Hunter bunker where she finds a team of four Hunters dead who were all infected by Green Poison, though something or someone else killed them. More importantly, she finds a USB drive containing a roster. However, Hoskins finds out that a reinforcement of Hunters were sent here, so she managed to escape Redacted using side-roads to avoid them. Eventually, Hoskins reached back to Keener and showed him the roster, which reveals the name of every Agent who were recruited into the Hunter Program, though it's currently unknown if there's Hunters who survived the First Wave, the Green Poison, or if Cal have recruited from off-the-books.\n\n==== Activation of a Hunter cell ====\nPrior to Agent Hoskins' arrival to [Redacted], Calvin McManus activated a Hunter and requested them to drop whatever they're doing and gather other Hunters as a cell to go to [Redacted]. While there was some difficulty at first, the Hunter Cell managed to make it to [Redacted] and set up a base within the Bunker. They were ordered to Cal to go to a secret entrance to secure the SHD Database.\n\nOne of the Hunters, Agent Zabala, calls Cal directly and informs him that Melanie Hoskins is on [Redacted]. While Cal is angry at Zabala for breaking protocol, however he became concerned when he learned of Hoskins' presence, deducing that she was manipulated by Aaron Keener who was after the Hunter roster. As a precaution, Cal ordered Zabala to secure the roster on a USB drive and wipe it off the SHD Database. Zabala wiped the roster from the database, and secured it on a USB drive.\n\n==== Mutated strain of Green Poison ====\nAgent Donovan Tower, the leader of the Hunter Cell in [Redacted] got infected by a mutated strain of Green Poison, including his teammates. A science team who came with them were puzzled about the strain and didn't know what to do. Tower reached out to Ann Arbor facility for help, but he lacked clearance to ask about the BSAV (Broad-Spectrum Anti-Virals) and was hung-up subsequently after being condescended by the Ann Arbor staff. Later on, he called up Agent McKenzie Reed in MIT regarding their progress for the BSAV, but they weren't ready which upset Tower heavily and got hung-up again. \n\nHowever, Tower would get a viable solution from [[Harlan Lloyd]] (The Strategist), when he and his fellow Outcasts took over DCD HQ, and informed the Agent that they should do blood tests in order to find a working solution against the mutated Green Poison. By the time the science team conducted the blood tests, Donovan Tower's sickness was getting pretty bad.\n\nIt is implied that the four dead Hunters that Agent Hoskins found in the bunker were Donovan Tower and his teammates.\n\n==== Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas' Brooklyn reports ====\nAfter the events at Coney Island, Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas reports to Natalya Sokolova that the BTSU Unit in New York that was led by Dolores Jones were decimated by Division Agents and Cleaners who were sent there under Vivian Conley. Douglas comments that Cleaners were becoming a problem ever since Conley took leadership after Joe Ferro's death. While Black Tusk's attention is on D.C, Douglas requested to Nat for a recon mission in New York as she believed Keener and his Rogues are still a big threat. \n\nNat approved Douglas's request. After a bit of recon, Douglas reports to her that things in Brooklyn are quieter compared to Manhattan. She also reports that Rikers have crossed the Bridge while Cleaners have been isolated to Lower Manhattan. She reports that with Agent Faye Lau's leadership, the Division managed to push Rikers further south and kept Cleaners numbers in check, even with Conley's help, the Cleaners don't have enough to expand their operations in Brooklyn. Douglas believes that the Cleaners are also planning something big with Keener after Coney Island. She suggested about recruiting local talent to support the mission, and believes there's an opportunity between Faye Lau and Alicia Coswald as both Agents both have a personal history together.\n\nAll in all, this was all a pretext for Douglas to maintain contact with Rogue Agent Aaron Keener, whom she had a secret alliance with him for a while and helping him in having Faye Lau infilitrate Black Tusk during the events of WONY.\n\n==== Report on Meret Estate ====\nBridgette Douglas was approached by Aaron Keener who wanted a report on the Meret Estate as well Mackenzie Meret. Douglas tells him that Mack is doing fine acting as a farmer and foster mother for all the people in Long Island. Keener, on the other hand, was concerned about Mack's safety, though Douglas assures him that Mack is fine and Natalya Sokolova would never do anything to her special project.\n\nBut evidently, [[Paradise Lost|Douglas' reassurance was proven wrong.]]\n\n==== The Morettis ====\nThe Morettis were a family that consisted of Mark, Sarah, and their daughter Grace who tried to find a way out of Lower Manhattan. They were rescued by Aaron Keener and his people when they were beset by raiders, then sent them away from Manhattan via a boat that'll take them to New Jersey.\n\nTragically, Sarah lost her husband and daughter during their trip to New Jersey. Keener feels guilt over the loss as he considered the Morettis as the first group of civilians that he truly felt he saved them, including the fact that a young girl like Grace died. Despite Bridgette Douglas' assurance it is not his fault and Sarah Morreti's assurance that she'll be fine, Keener feels like all the pep talk and condolences were empty platitudes.\n\n==== Purple Stuff ====\nIndeed, Natalya Sokolova covertly sent the Cleaners led by the Cleaner-embedded Hunter [[Wright]] and [[The Lovebirds]] to attack [[Meret Estate Settlement|Meret Estate]], with help of Rogue SHD Tech loaned from Calvin McManus. Division Agents sent by [[Alani Kelso]] managed to repel the assault and rescue [[Mackenzie Meret]] and some of her settlement's survivors, who were later sent to [[Haven]] to rest up.\n\nAaron Keener and Theo Parnell weren't happy about this course of events, though they're glad that Mack and some of her people are still alive. They learn that Wright, who's also one of Cal's Hunters, helped the Cleaners by supplying them with an accelerant that makes their flamethrowers burn purple. But what's more concerning to both Keener and Theo, however, is the fact The Lovebirds were given Rogue Tech, and they have no idea where they got it from. Theo admits they didn't keep good inventory on the Rogue Tech, which led to Keener suggesting they should start there.\n\n==== A Recruiting Drive ====\nOver the course of many conversations, Aaron Keener and Bridgette Douglas discuss about several people that could be potential recruits for Keener's settlement in Brooklyn. Interestingly, most of the conversations include members of the Castle Settlement who Division agents rescued when Black Tusk kidnapped them.\n\n===== Maral McCarthy =====\nMaral McCarthy was one of the civilians who was rescued twice by Rogue Agent Theo Parnell in Lower Manhattan and was later sent to Brooklyn for safety. At some point, Maral got into a relationship with Theo that consummated into becoming pregnant with his child. As per Theo's request, Aaron Keener talked with Bridgette Douglas about having Maral as the social director for his settlement. Douglas thinks it's a bad idea, even suggesting that Maral should be sent to Hoskin's farm, not at ground zero. Keener argues his settlement is not ground zero, though Douglas retorts that as far as Calvin McManus is concerned, anywhere Keener is living in is considered ground zero.\n\nThis leads Keener to rant against Cal, where the discussion shifts to a discussion regarding the former friendship that Keener had with the Secretary, where they used to agree about what the world should look like. Douglas thinks that both want the same thing, power, they just disagree on who should have it, even arguing that the war that Keener and Cal are fighting is another pointless war where everyone sacrifices themselves for a random person pulling the strings from the safety from their bunker.\n\nKeener argues that he can't leave his \"bunker\" when he's supposed to be \"dead\", and Douglas comments that he didn't think that part through. Keener remarks that as soon as Faye gets access to [[President Ellis]], they can move to stage 2 and he can come out of hiding.\n\n===== Birdie Malik =====\nAaron Keener and Bridgette Douglas discuss about recruiting Birdie Malik. Douglas thinks it's a bad idea, even if Keener thinks she's brilliant. But Douglas shared her apprehension, and mentioned that Birdie has no filter and her adopted brother Vikram is well known to be a dick. In addition, Natalya Sokolova values her and would never lose tabs on her. She also mentions that Birdie and Vikram were sent by Manny to the Castle Settlement after their rescue. but it's only a matter of time before Nat tries to take Birdie back. Keener agrees with Douglas' argument, suggesting to not go forward in recruiting Birdie and Vikram. \n\nThe discussion heavily implies that Douglas survived her encounter with SHD Agents in D.C during the events in [[End of Watch]]\n\n===== Lauren Fong =====\nA bit later, Keener and Douglas discuss about recruiting [[Lauren Fong]]. Douglas thinks Lauren is too much baggage, would never go anywhere without her deaf girlfriend [[Amanda Weekes]], and suggests not recruiting her unless he was looking to open a taco truck in Dumbo. Keener argues that he wants to set up Aquaponics at the Bridge, which has Douglas suggesting him to ask ANNA for schematics and raid a pet store.\n\n===== Mari Singh =====\nWhen discussing about setting up a fish farm, Bridgette Douglas suggested to Aaron Keener to look into recruiting [[Mari Singh]]. Keener was apprehensive, as Mari is Manny Ortega's pregnant girlfriend, though Douglas argues that he needs Mari's expertise if he wants to build a fish farm. Keener feels the only way to do that is getting Manny on their side, though Douglas comments Manny will put a bounty on him if he touches Mari. Keener finds that ridiculous as he can't believe that Manny is that insecure, but Douglas supported that notion. And argued that Manny is not only insecure, he's also overprotective and has Division agents at his disposal, which makes it a dangerous combination.\n\n===== Cindy McAllister =====\nAaron Keener and Bridgette Douglas discuss whether to recruit former drone operator, [[Cindy McAllister]]. Keener thinks having her is an opportunity considering the fact that [[Coney Island Ballpark|she took over Black Tusk's mortars at Coney Island]] and enjoyed using their own toys against them. However, Douglas comments that thanks to Manny, Cindy is in therapy and grounded, leading to Keener comment that Manny doesn't know how to spot talent. On the other hand, Douglas argues that Manny doesn't want to encourage people's bad behaviors.\n\nIn Keener's perspective, he sees bad behaviors as necessary skillsets, even commenting \"You say potato, I say Rogue agent potential\". Douglas argues that Cindy is not an agent, she's a normal person. Keener argues that a lot of Division agents were normal in the past, though Douglas retorts she was never normal, leading to Keener commenting \"We can't all be born with a golden bullet in the chamber\".\n\n===== Rodney Bishop/1 =====\nRodney Bishop was one of the civilians that Aaron Keener rescued in Lower Manhattan and later sent to Brooklyn for safety. When discussing about recruiting Bishop for the settlement, Bridgette Douglas teases Keener that Bishop loves him, which he denies it. Moreover, Douglas argues that Bishop worships Keener and thinks of him as a prophet, leading Keener to comment that Bishop would be the perfect candidate to spread the gospel of the Noble Rogues.\n\n===== Mitchell Billings =====\nAaron Keener and Bridgette Douglas talk about whether to recruit the Psychiatrist, Mitchell Billings. Douglas doesn't recommend recruiting him, mentioning the doctor is too ethical and loyal to his oath. Furthermore, she mentions that Billings serves for the community, takes care of anyone who needs help, and doesn't care for politics when the whole struggle is political. Thus, Douglas argues the best case scenario with Billings is that he will convince Keener that his ops are a bad idea and he should stand down and bend the knee to Natalya Sokolova, before more people get killed.\n\nKeener decided to not forward in recruiting Mitchell Billings. Though, Douglas mentions that Billings would be good to recruit if Keener wants a psychiatrist who can talk him down and make him emotionally healthy for the first time in his life.\n\n===== Rodney Bishop/2 =====\nThe discussion about Rodney Bishop returns, as it happens he got recruited by Aaron Keener to be in charge of the supplies for the settlement. Bridgette Douglas had some misgivings as she saw Bishop as a fanboy, despite Keener's insistence that he's trustworthy and loyal. She brings up the topic of Bishop's crush on Keener, which the rogue agent didn't want to divulge into. However, Douglas thinks that Bishop is in more in love with who Keener is, as Keener himself couldn't help being a charismatic leader. \n\nDouglas thinks that Keener is building a cult, but he maintains that he's building a community but believes there's a fine line between a ocmmunity and a cult. Douglas remarked that it helps having someone like Bishop as an acolyte spreading the gospel of \"Aaron Keener\", which Keener agrees.\n\n===== Eva Garcia =====\nAaron Keener goes over whether to recruit [[Eva Garcia]] for his settlement with Bridgette Douglas. Douglas didn't think much of Eva considering she sees the young woman as a kid with a podcast for extra credit. Keener thinks she's brilliant, which led to Douglas grossed out and thinking he has a romantic attraction to Eva, when he's older than her. Keener corrected that he'd like to recruit Eva Garcia for public communications, cuz he sees her way of speaking to the audience is captivating and knows how to entertain her audience. Whereas with Rodney Bishop, he's a true believer, but doesn't know how to entertain people.\n\n===== Jack Arnold =====\nAaron Keener discuss with Bridgette Douglas whether to recruit [[Jack Arnold]]. Douglas mentions the incident at [[Kenly College]] where Jack was tricked by the [[Brian Johnson|Hunters]] to go there and was left to die, then later rescued by Division agents. She admits there's a potential in recruiting Jack, but that'll come with a package deal. Therefore, if Keener wants to recruit Jack, he also needs recruit her spouse [[Mel Arnold|Mel]]. And Mel, as Douglas have said it herself, comes with baggage.\n\n===== Mel Arnold =====\nAaron Keener discuss with Bridgette Douglas about recruiting [[Mel Arnold]]. He thinks they're an excellent asset given their experience in speculative fiction, gardening, and sustainability, not even minding the baggage they have and would help feed minds and bodies. Douglas is apprehensive, given that Mel had a fair share of stalkers. Keener dismissed that notion, asking rhetorically that no one worth their salt never had a stalker, which Douglas protested it's not a complinment.\n\nDouglas mentions [[Cassandra Raines]], a fanatical fan of Mel's work, and reveals that the woman has built a cult called the Reborn. Keener thinks there's an opportunity with the organization, which Douglas believe that he's building a cult. Keener insists he's not building a cult, he just believes that having a cult in their back pocket is an opportunity to take advantage of, then he asks Douglas for the Reborn's location. Douglas answered that the Reborn are in Louisiana, but they've been west since the hurricane.\n\n==== The Sims ====\nAaron Keener presents the scanned hologram version of himself that was uploaded to the simulation and replicated via the Nemesis program to Bridgette Douglas. Douglas agrees with Theo's comment that Keener's scan looks like a hobo wizard, which was not a compliment. When Keener suggested updating the scan, Douglas disagreed, as she believed he can only fake his death once and it's only a matter of time before people take out the contact (Scan-tek Lenses) and shoot him in the head, just to be sure.\n\n==== Bardon Schaeffer ====\n[[Coney Island Amusement Park (Manhunt: Schaeffer)|After the events at Coney Island]], Bridgette Douglas confirmed to Aaron Keener that Bardon Schaeffer is alive, but in a coma due to wounds he sustained in his encounter with SHD agents. Keener was surprised, as he expected Schaeffer's little bait would've gotten him killed, even admitting he'd shocked if the former BTSU commander survives his coma for more than a week. Nevertheless, Schaeffer was sent to the White House under medical care, and being fed to stay alive.\n\nKeener asked Douglas if Schaeffer managed to send Faye's message to the Division, Douglas confirmed that Schaeffer didn't mangage to do so. And with him in a coma, she expressed concern that [[End of Watch|she's next in their hit-list]].\n\n=== Year 7 ===\nAlthough not much intel was there during the search for \"Glasses\" and \"Cassandra\", they'd become available once more on NSA Servers during Division's campaign against the Cleaners in Brooklyn, prompting the agents to go through the sim to collect them. The intel happens to involve the major characters before the events in ''[[Battle for Brooklyn]].'' \n\n==== Bridge ====\nAgent Melanie Hoskins was relocating Dr. Jessica Kandel to Brooklyn, promising that Faye Lau and Bridgette Douglas would arrive after the former finishes her business in D.C. When Kandel suggests telling Roy Benitez, Hoskins felt it'd be useless, arguing that Benitez would never understand as he'll never forgive Keener, especially given the damage he had done to the JTF.\n\nThis led Kandel asking Hoskins how she forgave Keener, which she admitted it was through his friendship with Douglas and Sarah Moretti. Hoskins then talks about how people shouldn't be judged on how they behave on their best or worst day, and they should be see on who they are when they get bored.\n\nHoskins admits that Keener is an asshole, but maintains that he's not evil. She sees him as a guy who lost himself in his trauma and took a destructive road back to the man he wanted to be. Kandel deduced that Hoskins meant Keener as the venture capitalist, but it's the opposite. She sees him as a hero and a friend.\n\nHoskins implores Kandel to see the work that Keener and his Rogues had built there is good, even maintaining that the man Keener was when he left cryptic messages to shittalk the Division, is no longer that man. She concludes her point by saying people need be given a chance to grow.\n\nKandel asks if Keener really still has the printer, but Hoskins is not aware what that is, and suggested to ask Theo Parnell for help.\n\n==== Amherst ====\nTheo Parnell and Jessica Kandel discuss about Amherst's printer that's being hidden in The Bridge, with the former expressing that he has the device, but not Amherst's research. Kandel objects, saying with ISAC, he has the research, every keystroke and failed experiment that Amherst made. Despite Parnell's assurance that Green Poison is not a threat anymore, Kandel argues that what Amherst accomplished had proved that any nutjob with the tech and resources can do something similar. Parnell then asks about the BSAV (Broad-Spectrum Anti-Virals) work she was doing in Ann Arbor, Kandel expresses that Natalya Sokolova had stole it and scrubbed her research. \n\nWhen the Rogue Agent expresses that Kelso and her fellow agents managed to get the anti-virals from Tidal Basin, Kandel questions why these vaccines aren't everywhere in the country, in which Parnell answers they don't have enough as they need to manufacture more than they could be able to and the means to distribute them. In that case, Kandel expresses that they have the tech with the printer, as Amherst's work proved it could be done. They just need the Ann Arbor recipe for the BSAV.\n\nIt was also revealed in this comm that the BSAV project at MIT and DCD facilities were abandoned, which makes Ann Arbor the only facility that managed to create the vaccine.\n\n==== Tchernenko ====\nTheo Parnell and Jessica Kandel discuss Vitaly Tchernenko, the Russian Virologist. Kandel calls him an idiot, and despite Parnell defending him, she insisted on her opinion since she mentions Tchernenko's role in creating the Eclipse Virus, when he was initially trying to create a cure for the Green Poison.\n\nAnd even with Parnell admitting the mistakes that were made in creating the Eclipse, Kandel insisted on getting rid of Tchernenko. Parnell didn't want to kill the virologist, however, so Kandel suggested him to kick Tchernenko out of her lab and out of her sight, concerned that he might try experimenting on people. \n\nGiven that Tchernenko was given to the Black Tusk during the events of Coney Island in August, it's safe to conclude that Parnell and Keener followed Kandel's orders.\n\n==== The Strategist ====\nTheo Parnell and Jessica Kandel discuss about Harlan Lloyd, also known as The Strategist. Kandel knows Lloyd as a paper pusher and bearucrat, though Parnell disagrees, given Harlan's work in creating a vaccine from an asymptomatic carrier. Kandel thought of that approach as torture, and even though Parnell mentions Donovan Tower who did the same approach, Kandel candidly thinks they were either monsters or idiots, then asks Theo if he knows what happened in the NSA's Detention Center.\n\nParnell correctly recalled that an asymptomatic carrier, Erica Gonzalez, was held there and infected the entire center. Kandel then mentions the True Sons' takeover, and torturing Gonzalez in hopes to develop a cure.\n\nKandel's whole point in this conversation is that people like Harlan Lloyd tried curing the Green Poison through \"the ends justifies the means\". And she refuses to torture people, just to develop a cure.\n\n==== Tower ====\nTheo Parnell and Jessica Kandel discuss Donovan Tower, due to his involvement with the Green Poison. Kandel doesn't consider him as important, citing Tower is not a doctor. Parnell then asks if he's a soldier, though Kandel corrects that Tower's a PMC, private security for Nelson, and a gun for hire. And given her past interaction with Tower, Kandel considers him the \"rudest motherfucker\" she had to call asking for updates on the BSAVs.\n\n==== Comm 96 ====\nWIP\n\n==== Comm 97 ====\nWIP\n\n==== Comm 98 ====\nWIP\n\n==== Comm 99 ====\nWIP\n\n==== Comm 100 ====\nWIP\n\n==== Comm 101 ====\nWIP\n\n==== Comm 102 ====\nWIP\n\n==== Comm 103 ====\nWIP\n\n==== Comm 104 ====\nWIP\n\n==== Comm 105 ====\nWIP\n\n==Mechanics==\nIn Descent, Agents are stripped of all their usual [[Skills/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|skills]] and [[Gear/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|gear]], including their [[Specializations|specialization weapons]] and bonuses, as well as their custom cosmetics. They start within a starter lobby room, in which they will have to press a button to initiate a \"loop\". After pressing the initial button, the agent's [[Smart Watch]] will switch from orange to green and the agent will now be able to use the Simulation's consoles (which glow green) and computers, which will grant them weapons and skills, as well as talents similar to those found in the normal game's gear and weapons. These talents can then be stacked in order to achieve various effects. \n\nIn the computers, players can buy upgrades, such as additional slots for talents, extra choices for weapons and skills and additional ammo, med kit and grenade capacity. Players can buy up to 3 extra slots for offensive, defensive and utility talents, allowing them to have a maximum of 6 talents of each respective category.\n\nThe consoles in the starting area can be used to select either a weapon or a skill. Only at the start can the player select both a weapon and skill. Skipping these choices will earn the player 250 [[File:Descent Currency.png|22px]] Descent Currency. Weapon quality can range from {{Worn|Gear|Worn}} to {{Specialized|Gear|Specialized}}. Only skills that don't require a specialization are available, meaning that players are unable to access the Mortar Turret, Banshee Pulse, Striker Shield, Scanner Drone, Artificer Hive or Mender Seeker Mine\n\nOnce the agents choose their weapons and skills, they can then leave the starter area and select between 2 to 3 different rooms. Upon selecting and entering a room, the simulation will then generate enemies from the marked red doors. \n\nOnce the agents defeats all enemies, or waves of enemies after loop 6, the room's encounter is concluded and a console will spawn, from which the agent can pick one of 3 available talents (4 if one purchases a special upgrade with [[File:NSA Tech.png|22px]]<span style=\"color:#4aa700\"> NSA Tech</span>)  or skip the choice in exchange for 250 [[File:Descent Currency.png|22px]] Descent Currency. Agents can also re-roll the talents in exchange for 250 [[File:Descent Currency.png|22px]] Descent Currency, with every subsequent roll increasing the price by an additional 250 [[File:Descent Currency.png|22px]] Descent Currency.\n\nIf the player has no space for any new talents, they can choose to overwrite a talent currently in their inventory with a new one. If the players select a talent that is already within their inventory, this talent will then be upgraded by one tier, which increases its effects by a certain amount.\n\nNSA Tech is also a resource that can be obtained through completion of high-value target rooms or completing the final room in each loop. It can be used to purchase caches (Exotic, Named Items, Reconstructed), Descent outfits in 4 different colors, and enhancing attributes base stats up to 10 for each of the three core attribute categories (Offensive, Defensive, and Utility) as permanent upgrades for the game mode. \n\n==Available Talents==\nThe following talents are available for the player to choose upon completing a room. Most of these talents are available in the open world, but have had their statistics altered in order to properly interact with Descent's talent stacking mechanic\n\nA player starts with 3 slots for each talent category (that being Offensive, Defensive, Utility and Exotic), but can purchase up to 3 extra slots, each for 1400 Descent Currency, allowing the player to have up to 21 different talents active. A player can only have up to 3 exotic talents at a time.\n\nNormal talents can be stacked up to 10 times, with each stack increasing the effects of the talent by a certain amount. Below, the talents and how they are upgraded per stack have been listed. The higher one stacks a talent, the lower a chance it has for re-appearing in a console.\n\n====Offensive====  \n\n*Obliterate: Critical hits increase total weapon damage by 1.5%(+0.5% per stack) for 5(+1 per stack) seconds.

Enemies spawned will be of the same tier and number as Hard Room enemies.\n**Named Enemies will almost always be of the \"Assault\" class from their specific faction. After loop 1, Named Enemies gain the ability of using an armor kit, with every subsequent loop adding one armor kit to their inventory [<sup>verification needed]</sup>.\n**Additionally, Named enemies can obtain the following deployable and/or abilities depending on the loop. These skills are not tied to any specific faction and will be listed with their names next to where the skill comes from in the standard game:\n***Explosive Cart (Hyena Tech)\n***Booster Pill (Hyena Rusher)\n***Rocket Launcher (True Sons Light Support)\n***Grenade Launcher (Hyenas/Black Tusk Grenadier)\n***Shield Turret (Riker Heavy Support)\n***Normal Turret (True Sons Engineer)\n***Sniper Turret (Hyenas Engineer)\n***Spotter Drone (Black Tusk Sniper)\n***Deployable Mines (Elite Hyena Sniper/Riker Grenadier)\n***Riot Foam Launcher (True Sons Riot Foamer)\n***Defibrillator (Hyena/True Sons/Black Tusk Medic)\n*** Defibrillator Drone(Black Tusk Medic)\n**Besides said abilities, Named Enemies also gain a special grenade, which can be of the following types:\n***Molotov\n***Incendiary Grenade (Applies Fire + Disorientation. Commonly found in Elite Grenadiers)\n***Riot Foam\n***Shrapnel (Applies Bleed)\n***Electric Grenade (Applies Shock. Commonly found in Elite Black Tusk Grenadier Hounds)\n***Flash Grenade (Commonly found in Elite Black Tusk Rushers and Underground Booby Traps)\n***DC-62 Grenade (Can be found in certain Named True Sons bosses)\n***Tear Gas (Named Hyena bosses)\n**These rooms will always increase the Nemesis Temperature by 2% - 3% and will never yield anything higher than 700 Descent Currency.\n**These rooms will always award NSA Tech upon completion.\n*'''ARENA'''\n**Spawns the same number of waves as any other prior room within said loop then will spawn one additional wave alongside a Named enemy. Enemies spawned will be of the same difficulty and number as a Hard room.\n**Will always appear as the final room of a loop.\n**Will always award 1000 Descent Currency, plus an additional 500 per loop<sup>[verification needed]</sup>, upon completion.\n** Will always award NSA Tech upon completion.\n**These rooms never increase Nemesis Temperature.\n** Completing these rooms always awards one extra attribute point. Additionally, it will always award an Exotic Talent on loop 1, then award an additional exotic talent every 5 loops after reaching loop 5. Once the player has acquired 3 exotic talents, this room will then begin awarding an Exotic Talent upon completion on every loop.\n\n====Modifiers====\nAdditionally, rooms can include the following modifiers within them. These modifiers can occur independent of room difficulty:\n\n*Chem Vapor Hazard: Clouds of [[Chem Launcher#Firestarter|Flammable Vapour]] are generated in select spots around the selected room\n* Fire Hazard: Certain locations of the room are permanently set on fire. In certain rooms, the fire can rotate between a number of select places\n* Electric Hazard: Certain locations of the room are littered with exposed cables and a periodic power surge electrocutes anyone nearby\n*Poison Hazard: Clouds of Toxic Gas are generated in select spots around the selected room. These clouds do not dissipate and are permanent\n* Steam Hazard: Certain places of the map are covered in water vapor, which deals periodic health damage to anyone within their radius\n* Supply Store: This modifier does not influence the encounter in any way. Instead, at the end of the encounter, a supply shop is spawned within the room. In this supply shop, players can restock their ammunition for a select weapon (240 Descent Currency for a full restock), purchase Special Ammo (400 Descent Currency for 1 whole magazine. Affected by talents) and resupply their medkits and grenades (each costing 250 Descent Currency)\n\n==Enemies==\nOnly the following factions can appear as Enemies in Descent:\n\n*[[Black Tusk]]\n*[[Hyenas]]\n*[[Cleaners]]\n*[[Outcasts]]\n*[[Rikers]]\n*[[True Sons]]\n\nAdditionally, every fifth loop, enemy difficulty is increased. After loop 5, Veteran Enemies with 2 bars of armor are introduced, similar to Veteran enemies on the main game's \"Hard\" difficulty. After loop 10, all Veteran enemies have the usual 4 bars of armor. After loop 15, Elite enemies with 4 bars of armor are introduced as well. Past loop 20, fully armored elites and faction-respective Tank units are introduced. Every Hard difficulty room after loop 10 has a random chance of spawning Rogue Agents instead of a normal wave. The Rogue Agents can only replace one wave of enemies per room and can replace the Named Enemies in High Value Target difficulty rooms<sup>[verification needed]</sup>\n\n====Additional Mechanics====\nLastly, completing up to 3 subsequent rooms of the same difficulty will prevent players from accessing a room of said difficulty for the next 3 rooms<sup>[verification needed]</sup>. This mechanic continues even through loops and it doesn't count the Arena room. For example, if a player completes 3 consecutive Easy rooms, they will only find rooms of the Normal and Hard difficulties for the next 3 rooms, excluding the Arena room. Playing 2 Hard rooms and 1 High Value target rooms also counts for this mechanic.<sup>[verification needed]</sup>\n\nThis mechanic allows players to encounter up to 2 consecutive High Value Target rooms in any given loop.\n\n==Possible \"Tilesets\"==\nBelow you can find a list of possible \"Tile sets\", which is the grouping of physical locations one can find themselves in. As of time of writing, there are only 2 tilesets that can be run in 2 different orders, which have been dubbed \"Side A\" and \"Side B\" for convenience.\n\n*'''NSA Research Labs'''\n**'''Side A Exclusive''' \n***Lobby Spawn Room\n***Wind Testing Lab Arena\n**'''Side B Exclusive'''\n***Maintenance Access Spawn Room\n***White House Testing Room Arena\n**'''Shared''' \n***Combustion Lab\n***Boiler Room\n***Ventilation Shaft\n***Workshop\n***Electricity Lab\n***3D Printing\n***Chemical Lab\n***Security Room\n***EMP Lab\n***Server Room\n*'''Potomac Bunker Complex'''\n**'''Side A Exclusive''' \n***Construction Site Arena\n**'''Side B Exclusive'''\n***Missile Silo Arena\n**'''Shared'''\n***Bunker Door Spawn Room\n***Generator Room\n***Transmission Room\n***Cafeteria\n***Officer's Lounge\n***Sealed Tunnel Room\n***Transit Tunnel Room\n***Server Room\n***Water Treatment Room\n***Warehouse\n***Medical Unit\n***All connecting tunnels\n\n==Nemesis==\n[[File:Keener.png|thumb|300px]]\nThe Nemesis is the final boss of Descent. With every room completed, the player will slowly increase their proximity to Nemesis, or the \"Nemesis Temperature\". Once a player reaches 100% Nemesis Temperature, they will be loaded into the Nemesis encounter stage once the current loop is completed.\n\n====Fight with Nemesis ====\nUpon reaching the Nemesis stage, players are greeted only by 2 shops, the Upgrade Shop and a Supply Shop, instead of the usual Upgrade Shop and Simulation Console. Players can not choose a new weapon or skill in this stage.\n\nAn Ammo Crate, Medkit Crate and Grenade Crate can be found right next to the shops. upon entering the Nemesis stage, players will have to press a button, which will then show a short cutscene and generate the Nemesis battle stage.\n\nThe Nemesis Battle Stage consists of a semi-symmetrical scenario of glowing, green-and-black, octagonal pillars. The scenario consists of 4 landmarks\n\nLooking from the Spawn Area:   \n\n*White House (West)\n*Ventilation Fan(East)\n*Bunker Walls(North)\n* Spawn(South)\n\nThe doors in the room are located in the corners between landmarks EXCEPTING the corner between the Spawn and Ventilation Fan. All doors are marked and will allow Nemesis to spawn.\n\nNemesis then spawns from one of the 3 available doors. Nemesis will always spawn in an amount similar to the amount of players currently in the stage, meaning that one can fight up to 4 Nemesis Bosses. Every Nemesis Boss spawns in different locations but never directly next to the player(s). When Nemesis spawns, they will generate a smoke cloud and inflict Disruption on the player(s), similar to how a Hunter spawns.\n\nNemesis (as in, the Named Enemies that are spawned) will always have the same type of weapons and skills as the player(s) they are imitating, with some notable exceptions and particular behaviors \n\n* In Case the Player has a Revive or Stimulant [[Hive]], Nemesis will spawn with a Restorer Hive. Else, Nemesis will have a Stinger Hive or Restorer Hive depending on which variant of the 2 the player has equipped.\n*In Case the Player has a [[Turret]], [[Trap (Skill)|Trap]] or [[Drone (Skill)|Drone]] of any kind, Nemesis will have the same type of turret/drone/trap as the player.\n*In Case the Player has an Explosive or Cluster [[Seeker Mine/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Seeker Mine]], Nemesis will have an Explosive Seeker Mine. Else, if the player is using an Airburst Mine, Nemesis will have the same type of Seeker Mine as the player\n* If the Player has a [[Decoy]], Nemesis may also deploy a Decoy.<sup>[verification needed]</sup>\n*In Case the Player has a [[Chem Launcher]] or [[Sticky Bomb/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Sticky Bomb]], Nemesis will have the same type as the player\n*If the Player has any type of [[Pulse/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Pulse]], Nemesis will '''NOT''' have a Pulse.<sup>[verification needed]</sup>\n*If the Player has a [[Ballistic Shield/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|shield]] of any kind, Nemesis will '''NOT''' have a shield.<sup>[verification needed]</sup>\n\nAdditionally, Nemesis can hack the following skills that the player deploys:\n\n*All Turrets and Seeker Mines\n*Striker Drone<sup>[verification needed]</sup>\n* Stinger Hive<sup>[verification needed]</sup>\nIf the Nemesis cannot copy one of your abilities, he can spawn with one of the following:\n\n*Stinger Hive\n*Sniper Turret\n*[list incomplete]\n\nNemesis will always be immune to Shock Rounds but will still be vulnerable to the Shock Status Effect that comes from other sources. However, Nemesis is highly resistant to Shock and will usually only be paralyzed by it for 2 seconds. Nemesis is otherwise vulnerable to other status effects like any other named enemy.\n\nNemesis will always use one of the following names: \n\n*Alpha\n*Bravo\n*Charlie\n*Delta\n*Echo\n\nUpon defeating Nemesis, the player is then greeted with a final menu screen, from which they can either exit to the normal game world or continue their run. After defeating Nemesis, the Nemesis Temperature will no longer rise. The Highest Loop at which one can defeat Nemesis is Loop 10\n\n==Hidden Patches==\nThere are some hidden patches within Descent that are awarded by completing loops 10, 20, 30 and 40, as well as defeating Nemesis at loop 10.\n\nThese patches are awarded once per season, starting on Y5S1: Broken Wings.\n\n==Talent Rotations==\nIn Y5S3: Vanguard, Talent Rotations were added to Descent. These rotations change every 3 days and come with different set of talents for Offensive, Defensive, Utility categories\n\nThe available rotations are:  \n\n*Gluttony\n*Greed\n* Sloth\n*Envy\n*Wrath\n\n==Rewards==\nThe Rewards for defeating Nemesis are the following   \n\n*Audio Collectible (Minimum of 1 per week. Possible to obtain more upon completing loops after Nemesis)\n*Simulation Cache\n*Exotic Cache\n*Reconstructed Cache(Has a chance of 50% of dropping once defeated. Will reward a blueprint for certain Dark Zone Exclusive Named Items)\n*Experience\n*Credits\n\n==NSA Stations==\n[[File:NSA Station.jpg|thumb|300px|NSA Station]]\nOutside of either entrance to the Descent facility are '''NSA Stations''', where agents can spend [[File:NSA Tech.png|22px]]<span style=\"color:#4aa700\"> NSA Tech</span> to purchase exclusive items, Outfits, and Sealed Caches, as well as permanent Descent upgrades to aid them in future Loops. \n\nThese include '''Reconstructed Caches''', which contain [[File:Blueprint.png|22px]]Blueprints for Named Items that allow them to be crafted at any Crafting Station, and cannot be obtained elsewhere.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Trivia==  \n\n*Once a week, players can complete a special Project that requires them to defeat Nemesis to be awarded One Collectible Audio. However, continuing past Nemesis has a chance to award up to 3 additional audio collectibles. This only works if the weekly project for Descent hasn't been completed.\n* Nemesis will always re-use a model for a previous Rogue Agent, the only difference being that the model now has a green grid texture overlayed on top of its geometry. As of Y5S2: Puppeteers, Nemesis can re-use the following Rogue Agent Models:\n**[[Molly \"Jupiter\" Henderson|Jupiter]]\n**[[Marley \"Shade\" Yarrow|Shade]]\n**[[Carter \"Hornet\" Leroux|Hornet]]\n**[[Tegan \"Luna\" Silver|Luna]]\n**[[Javier Kajika|Kajika]]\n**[[Chadwick \"Neptune\" Brandon III|Neptune]]\n**[[Ryan \"Mercury\" Chang|Mercury]]\n**[[Lucy \"Venus\" Anders|Venus]]\n**[[Mary \"Saturn\" Masters|Saturn]]\n**[[Lori \"Termite\" Baker|Termite]]\n**[[Elija \"Huntsman\" Le|Huntsman]]\n**[[Jason \"Titan\" Barnes|Titan]]\n**[[Sueko \"Wraith\" Tanagi|Wraith]]\n**[[Linette \"Dusk\" Edwards|Dusk]]\n**[[Skyler \"Belfry\" Williams|Belfry]]\n**[[Bridgette \"Viper\" Douglas|Viper]]\n**[[Felix \"Kestrel\" Sokolov|Kestrel]]\n**[[Dustin \"Magnus\" Xavier|Magnus]]\n**[[Alicia \"Circe\" Coswald|Circe]]\n**[[Aaron Keener|Keener]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" spacing=\"small\" columns=\"4\">\nFile:FutZCt6XwAAi9yj.jpg\nFile:IMG 3212.jpeg\nFile:NEMESIS corpse.png|Detail of a defeated \"Nemesis\" enemy.

When she was wounded in action after the explosion of the helicopter that killed the original Senior Second Wave commander, [[Louis Chang]], she had to assume Chang's role by assisting the player in the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]]. \n\nIn ''[[Warlords of New York]]'', she initiated a shocking turn of events when she [[Rogue Division Agents|disavowed The Division]] by talking to [[Bardon Schaeffer]] after [[Aaron Keener]] activated the [[Rogue Network]]. Eventually, the agents located her at Camp White Oak and ended her life for her allegiance to Black Tusk.\n\nIn ''[[Hidden Alliance]]'', after Faye's death, it was revealed she had a series of encrypted comms as insurance policy where it revealed she was working undercover and was working to aid the Division against Black Tusk the whole time and was trying to warn them about the Hunters. \n\nIn ''[[Vanguard]]'', more was unraveled about Faye as it is revealed she was working secretly with Aaron Keener under the codename Cassandra in her mission to undermine the Black Tusk and the Hunters.\n\nIn ''[[Burden of Truth]],'' the truth behind Faye's mission was unraveled, as it revealed her mission was to obtain the Presidential Clearance for The Ark Protocol as part of a grander operation to take down Black Tusk's Network.\n\n== Biography ==\nWhile enrolled at City College, Lau joined the school's ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps). She used her service as a springboard to a series of appointments in military intelligence and eventually the NSA (National Security Agency), where she worked on the support staff of the Director of National Intelligence. Soon after Presidential [[Directive 51]] was signed, Lau moved laterally into the newly formed [[Strategic Homeland Division]] as a senior field officer reporting directly to the northeast section Division Commander, [[Louis Chang]].\n\nAfter the First Wave of Division agents disappeared during the [[Green Poison]] bioweapon contagion, [[President Waller]] activated a Second Wave of agents into [[New York City]], ordering Commander Chang to personally lead the team's insertion and operations. Agent Lau was activated to serve as Chang's second in command and senior field officer. When their helicopter was destroyed, Commander Chang was killed and Lau seriously wounded.\n\nBarred from field work due to her injuries, Agent Lau has served as acting Division Commander for the region, working from the N.Y.C. [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]] located inside the James Farley Post Office in [[Pennsylvania Plaza]]. Her current role is primary contact and \"handler\" for all Division agents active in the New York City area. (NOTE: This has changed since she went rogue) \n\n\n== Tom Clancy's The Division ==\nFaye Lau was activated as part of the Second Wave of [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents in [[Brooklyn]] along with the player, with whom she was to partner up with.\n\nAfter regaining control of Brooklyn, she and the player were awaiting a VTOL carrying other Second Wave Division Agents and Senior Second Wave Commander [[Louis Chang]]. Unfortunately, the VTOL was destroyed in an explosion (later revealed to be caused by an [[Last Man Battalion|LMB]] surface-to-air missile) just as it landed, killing everyone on board and critically injuring Faye, whereas the player suffered minor injuries and was knocked unconscious.\n\nAfter the explosion, a [[Joint Task Force]] helicopter came to their aid and transported the two agents to [[Camp Hudson]].\n\nAfter the player gains control of the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations]], Faye takes the role of acting commander of The Division in New York. She then continues to provide strategical support to the player and other remaining Second Wave Division agents in New York.\n\n\n== Tom Clancy's The Division 2  ==\nFaye is once more seen in a cutscene for ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]'', killing an Incinerator boss type after the reactivation of the [[SHD Network]], implying that she fully recovered from the injuries in her ongoing quest\u00a0to take back [[New York City]] seven months after the [[Green Poison]], as well as being indirectly mentioned in an audio recording found in [[Washington, D.C.]] detailing [[Roy Benitez]]'s reaction at hearing that two [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents have been brought in.\n\n\n== Warlords of New York ==\nIn ''[[Warlords of New York]]'', she is the acting commander of [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]] in the city, as well as leading the hunt for [[Aaron Keener]], but the New York Division branch has been crippled after a devastating hurricane rocked [[Lower Manhattan]], as well as new leadership in the forms of [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Agents]] leading returning factions such as the [[Cleaners]] and the [[Rikers]].\n\nWith help from [[Alani Kelso]] and other Division agents from [[Washington, D.C.]], she continues the hunt for Keener. In a shocking turn of events, Lau disavowed The Division by siding with [[Black Tusk]] as her conversation between herself and [[Bardon Schaeffer]] was intercepted as the rogue agent network was activated.\n\nThe most probable reason for her going rogue was caused by her sister\u2019s death following the attack on the [[Hell's Kitchen]] settlement. Another probable reason for her to go rogue was after close interrogation with rogue agent [[Alicia Coswald]], who said she's on the side of The Division by going rogue. According to her, she was marked rogue when she disobeyed a direct order or directive, but however her aim was the same; to restore order. Therefore, it can be concluded that Faye went rogue because she chose to disobey the directives of The Division, and now she wants to bring the organization down in order to restore order and control by siding with the Black Tusk, who work for [[Natalya Sokolova]]. She recruited several rogue agents into Black Tusk, including [[Marley \"Shade\" Yarrow|Shade]], [[Linette \"Dusk\" Edwards|Dusk]] and [[Skyler \"Belfry\" Williams|Belfry]].\n\nHowever, as revealed in ''[[Vanguard|Y5S3: Vanguard]],'' Lau was working secretly with Keener to undermine the Black Tusk and the [[Hunters]] during the events of this story. Her sister's death due to \"budget cuts\" was enough to motivate her to join the PMC so she could get closer to their infrastructure and hit them where it truly hurts.  \n\nIn fact, Faye was trying to aid the Division the whole time, but the methods were not up to [[ISAC]]'s standards, which marked her Rogue.\n\n\n== End of Watch ==\n{{Quote|I did what I had to do.\u00a0 What we needed to do.\u00a0 I made the hard choice and did what was necessary.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to come quietly.\u00a0 I\u2019ve served my country.\u00a0 I did what we were trained to do, to make sure that our mission was maintained.\u00a0 If you choose not to honor that service, you\u2019re the one off mission.\u00a0 I will bury you, just like I buried [[Aaron Keener|Keener]].|Faye Lau, upon knowing the player has enough evidence of her guilt and before engaging the agents she once fought alongside with}}\nDuring Season 4 - ''[[End of Watch]]'', Faye Lau's four [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue]] lieutenants were hunted down and killed. The intel gathered from them leads to a confrontation with Lau in [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: Faye Lau)|Camp White Oak]]. While she is here, Lau kills [[President Ellis]] and frames [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]] for it. She attempts to flee in a helicopter, but it is disabled before she can make an escape. Forced to fight the very agents she turned her back on, she is killed. After her death, several audio logs are discovered. The logs tell a story of Lau going rogue solely to work her way up in the [[Black Tusk|B.T.S.U.]] ranks in order to assassinate the president. Her main aim was to eliminate the corruption that prevents order being restored.\n\n[[Roy Benitez]] had asked [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]] what she planned to do with Lau's body, she wanted to give Lau's body to the crows who were flying above her, but [[Paul Rhodes]] immediately decided against it. Eventually, Roy convinced Kelso completely, therefore, Lau's body was placed into a [[CERA]] body bag and flown to [[New York City]] for a proper burial at [[Haven]]. \n\n\n== Hidden Alliance ==\n{{Quote|We're family now. We bonded fighting this war, Kelso. You're the only sister I have left. I couldn't tell you what I was planning. I needed you angry at me to keep my cover. I'm sorry. I know I hurt you. But I couldn't find another way to do this. Please know it only went down this way because the Division couldn't afford to lose you too. They need a leader and you're the only one I trust.|Faye Lau, in the first insurance recording file, apologizing to Kelso for deceiving her fellow agent}}\nPrior to her death, Lau left a series of comms as insurance policy that was found by [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]]. Those comms were encrypted and had to be decrypted over time. After the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] dealt with the resurgent [[True Sons]] and reluctantly allied with Captain [[Captain Lewis|Lewis]] to stop [[Black Tusk]] in [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center]], all the comms were eventually decrypted. \n\nIn those comms, it was revealed that the [[Hunters]] were working for Homeland Security. And that Faye Lau and [[Bardon Schaeffer]] worked together to aid the Division by having the latter act himself as bait in [[Coney Island Amusement Park (Manhunt: Schaeffer)|Coney Island]], prompting the agents to capture him. They betted their plan that Schaeffer would share the truth and who's the threat towards the Division. It's possible that she secretly told him that a number of the Hunters are embedded in the Division as agents. \n\nHowever, due to Schaeffer was far from waking up, due to [[Joshua Summers|certain meddling]]. And given the Division learned that one of their own is a Hunter during their hunt against [[Brian Johnson|The Recruiter]], its unclear how much Schaeffer could offer to the table. \n\n\n== Vanguard ==\n{{Quote|I don't expect you to trust me. But, I think we can help each other. With our little Hunter problem. (...) You think me and my Rogues have been targeting Division. This couldn't be further from the truth, Faye. If you really want to stop the Hunters... I can stop them. Well, I can't. But if we work together, we might stand a chance.|Aaron Keener in an ECHO he left behind in a safehouse meant for Faye, later discovered by Agent Kelso}}\nIn her hunt for truth in [[New York City|New York]], Kelso learned from a reconstructed [[ECHO]] that Faye Lau was secretly working with [[Aaron Keener|Keener]] to undermine the [[Black Tusk]] and the [[Hunters]] with her secret codename being Cassandra (named after the Trojan Priestess from Greek Mythology) with the key being a [[Mobile SHD Server]] inside a SHD Crate that could only open by a secret two-factor authentication. Comms revealed that Lau was close to ending the alliance when Keener attacked [[City Hall]] with his [[Eclipse Virus]] to root out Hunters embedded as [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents, but she stayed knowing there was no other way. \n\nBecause of these revelations, Kelso joined Keener and [[Theo Parnell|Parnell]] to work with them to stop [[Natalya Sokolova]] and the Black Tusk, taking the Mobile SHD Server with them. [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]]'s reasoning was that Lau was close to putting an end to all the insanity and wanting to finish what she started.\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn the weeks after her death and her subsequent cremation, Faye Lau's actions while going undercover had a considerable impact on her loved ones and her Division colleagues as they try to focus their struggle against their nemesis.\n\nFurthermore, Lau saw Alani Kelso as family, as her first encrypted message from her laptop had her apologize to Kelso for the deception and wanted to have her in the fight against Black Tusk and the Hunters. The revelation that Lau was actually helping the Division this whole time, had redeemeed her in Kelso's eyes as well as with Roy Benitez, even though Paul Rhodes is still bitter about the deception.\n\nAnd when Kelso learned of Lau's involvement with Aaron Keener, Theo Parnell, Bridgette Douglas, and Bardon Schaeffer, she took the Cassandra codename for their mission against Black Tusk, to both honor Lau and vowing to see it finished.\n\nEven further, at the climax in ''[[Burden of Truth]],'' when the Division recovered Faye Lau's Mobile SHD Server in Roosevelt Island after eliminating the True Sons over there, they learned from an ECHO that President Ellis had transferred his clearance for the Ark Protocol to Lau's smart watch, to prevent Natalya Sokolova from taking it.\n\nAnd with Lau's watch in Kelso's hands, it will play an important role in the coming conflict.\n\n== Personality ==\nA second generation Chinese-American, Lau\u2019s parents were killed in a car crash when she was a seventeen, leaving her to raise her younger sister [[Heather Lau]]. Owed, in part, to the loss of her parents,\u00a0Lau has kept a distance from intimacy for much of her life, having regarded it as a potential disruption to her education and career.\u00a0Now that the [[Green Poison]] has hit, however, Lau has realized that she may be more attached to the surrounding people than she previously believed. A light in this is the attachment to her sister and worry that something bad may have happened to her when she goes missing from [[Camp Hudson]].\n\nLau later joined Reserve Officers' Training Corps\u00a0(ROTC) at City College, after which she excelled through the upper echelons of\u00a0government intelligence\u00a0and national security. After a field accident left her left leg and right eye severely injured,\u00a0Lau now serves as a \"handler\", responsible for the base\u2019s maintenance and collecting and giving intel to the player.\n\nCompetitive, driven, and full of grit,\u00a0there is no question in Lau\u2019s status as a devoted patriot\u00a0or her belief in the system. Though her peers typically regard her as a strong, serious woman, she has a caustic sense of humor, a knack for knitting, and a secret love of romantic movies.\n\nBy the ''[[Warlords of New York]]'' campaign, she is much harsher than before, and more aggressive. This may be attributed to Heather Lau, her younger sister, having been killed during a [[Rikers|Riker]] attack on a settlement in [[Hell's Kitchen]], which caused her to start drinking. Over the course of the campaign against [[Aaron Keener|Keener]] and his [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue agents]], Faye is shown to drop hints of doubt in The Division's ability to truly defeat Keener.\n\nHowever, as revealed by ''[[Hidden Alliance]]'' and ''[[Vanguard]]'', Faye was shown to be the driven Division agent and was aiding her fellow agents secretly. The fact that she was working for [[Black Tusk]] as a cover to undermine the organization hurt her emotionally, considering it put a rift to her loved ones. While she was only mentioned in comms in ''Vanguard'' and ''[[First Rogue]]'', its clear that her alliance with [[Aaron Keener|Keener]] was out of convenience and desperation knowing that the rogue agent has the key to put a stop to Black Tusk.\n\n\n== Equipment==\nIn-game, Faye Lau is a [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Agent]] armed with a [[Lightweight M4]], [[UMP-45/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Tactical UMP-45]], [[Drone (Skill)|Striker Drone]], [[Sticky Bomb|EMP Sticky Bomb]] and [[Grenades/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Fragmentation Grenades]].\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nFaye Lau gear.png\nFaye.png\nShd-agent-dossier-faye-lau-324x419.jpg|A brief summary about Faye Lau in The Division Intelligence Briefs\nMiguel-iglesias-untitled-1.jpg|Faye Lau character model art\nFaye Lau Div 2.JPG|Faye Lau during the SHD Network restoration cutscene in The Division 2.\nFaye Lau .png|Faye Lau in a boat with her Smart Watch and talking to Bardon.\nFile:Faye Lau HVT.png\nFile:FayeLau.png\nFile:Faye Lau.png\nFile:Vlcsnap-2020-12-31-22h41m16s817.jpg\nFile:Vlcsnap-2020-12-11-21h01m29s961.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Trivia ==\n*Curiously, in the ECHO that shows Lau assassinating Ellis, both characters are represent by the logo of [[Outcasts]] faction instead of the respective factions' logos. The cause of this is still unknown, though most likely a mistake.\n*Faye Lau's codename, Cassandra, that was given by Aaron Keener and revealed in Year 5 Season 3: Vanguard is named after the trojan priestess from Greek Mythology. In the mythology, Cassandra was known to utter true prophecies that would never be belived. This makes sense as Lau was trying to warn her former allies about the danger that Black Tusk and the Hunters represent, but wouldn't be believed until after her death and her insurance policy was discovered.\n*Despite never being seen effectively using these in-game, Faye could be seen holding a [[Vector/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Vector SBR .45 ACP]] in her in-game character artwork, a [[Maxim 9]] pistol in her promotional artwork and a [[POF P416/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Military P416]] in the in-game briefing video. \n**Additionally, despite never using it in combat against the player, Faye is also often depicted as using a [[P320 XCompact]] (which can be seen holstered in her chest rig), such as when she assassinates Ellis.<br />\n\n\n==Missions==\n===Tom Clancy's The Division 2: Warlords of New York=== \n*[[Stranded Tanker]] (voice only)\n*[[Pathway Park]] (voice only)\n*[[Wall Street (Mission)|Wall Street]] (voice only)\n*[[The Tombs]] (voice only)\n*[[Liberty Island]] (cutscene only)\n*[[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: Faye Lau)|Camp White Oak Manhunt: Faye Lau]]\n\n\n== Other Media==\n===''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad''===\n[[File:Lau 1.png|thumb|130px]]Faye Lau was featured in ''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad'' as part of The Division faction.

It was later relocated to the nearby Camden City Hall, which was deemed more defensible. \n\nDuring the winter months that marked the height of the [[Green Poison]] pandemic, the settlement struggled with everything, from electricity to food and clean water, as well as constant attacks from the outside. Fortunately, most of the civilians survived, partly thanks to the presence of three agents from the [[Strategic Homeland Division]]. By March 2016, however, [[Heather Ward]] was the only agent remaining; the fates of the others is unknown. \n\n===''Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis''===\nIn February 2016, the settlement was accosted by the [[Founders]], a local paramilitary group, who began demanding weekly tributes of supplies in exchange for upholding \"security\". After they were refused, the Founders returned with a mortar and machine guns and began a months-long string of attacks against the settlement. While the residents managed to fend them off, the Founders would always return, stronger and better armed each time.\n\nAt around the same time, a young member named [[Timmy]] defected from the Founders and sought to join the settlement. Agent Ward took him in, initially believing he was a spy whom she could feed false intel, but Timmy eventually proved himself trustworthy.  \n\nIn April, Ward met fellow Division agent [[Caleb Dunne]] while hunting wild turkeys, and invited him to the Camden Settlement.  Dunne had traveled from [[New York City]] in search a woman who previously killed his close friend [[Mathias Kaminsky]]. They found the settlement once again under attack by the Founders, and fought them off together. Afterwards, Dunne remarked that the Founders' circumstances were similar to those of the [[Last Man Battalion]] in New York, who had recently begun receiving heavy weaponry from an unknown source.  \n\nInside, Ward introduced Dunne to Timmy. The young man helped Dunne identify his target as \"[[Mantis]],\" who had previously visited the Founders' headquarters at Independence Hall. The agents then convinced Timmy to help them infiltrate the the compound under cover of night. While there was no trace of Mantis, they succeeded in destroying the Founders' armory and assassinating one of their leaders. However, Timmy was shot and killed during their escape.  \n\nWith the Founders no longer an imminent threat, Agent Ward decided that the Camden Settlement could now manage without her, and left with Agent Dunne to [[Fort Meade]] in Maryland.  \n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis]]''\n[[Category:Settlements]]\n[[Category:Comics]]",

After he and his men were left stranded in [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]]'s quarantine zone during the outbreak of [[Green Poison]], Bliss broke ties with the [[Joint Task Force]] and his clients on Wall Street, resolving to take back control of the city using his own brand of martial law.\n\nHe is an antagonist in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]'' during the Mission [[General Assembly]].\n\n==Biography==\nBliss served in U.S. Army's 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment, better known as \"Delta Force\", where he fought in conflicts such as the Gulf War. Following his retirement, he transitioned to the private security sector and formed the Last Man Battalion, a private military company comprised almost entirely of highly-trained military and special forces veterans. \n\nAs the [[Green Poison]] epidemic swept through New York City, Bliss was hired by several Wall Street financial firms to guard their server farms and high-value assets in Lower Manhattan. The LMB initially coordinated with the [[Joint Task Force]] and [[Strategic Homeland Division]] to maintain civil order, but as the Financial District descended into anarchy, Bliss began to detest the local authorities as pathetically weak and indecisive, working under restrictions that had no place in what was swiftly becoming a war zone. \n\nWhen the JTF established a quarantine and pulled back to their main base in Midtown, the LMB found themselves abandoned in what had now been declared the \"[[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]]\". Following a heated disagreement, Bliss executed his JTF liaison and declared his intention to take the city back from \"degenerates, liars, and thieves,\" using the same tactics the LMB had employed in Western Asia and North Africa--even if it meant defying his own country. \n\nSoon afterwards, Bliss was contacted by [[Aaron Keener]], a first-wave Division agent who had also become dissatisfied with JTF leadership and gone [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue]] with several of his cohorts. The two men found they shared a similarly grim outlook for a Darwinian post-pandemic world fit only for the strong, and agreed to a provisionary alliance: Bliss  provided Keener's rogues a base of operations and the LMB's manpower in exchange for their services, field intel, and access to [[SHD Tech]]. Several rogues, such as [[Scarecrow]], were appointed captains within the LMB command.  \n\nBliss also attempted to broker peace with the [[Rikers]] and [[Cleaners]], with limited success. \n\n\n=== ''Tom Clancy's The Division'' ===\nOn January 6th, Bliss ordered a surface-to-air missile strike that downed an Osprey carrying [[Louis Chang]], the northeast section Division commander. Consequently, command of The Division's Second Wave fell to Agent [[Faye Lau]], who sustained injuries in the attack that disqualified her for field duty.  \n\nDespite suffering key losses, The Division's Second Wave distinguished themselves in retaking Manhattan, fighting block-by-block and pushing the LMB out of key strategic locations. Bliss was eventually cornered in the LMB's last foothold in Manhattan: the United Nations [[General Assembly]]. A frontal assault by the JTF allowed Division agents to infiltrate the headquarters and disable the LMB's automated defenses. \n\nDuring the fighting, Keener chose to abandon the LMB, taking along captured Russian immunologist [[Vitaly Tchernenko]] and ordering his lieutenants to engage The Division. Furious at the betrayal, Bliss ordered his troops to stop Keener as Division agents and JTF wiped out his remaining command staff. The LMB leader managed to board a helicopter, but rather than flee, he opted to use the gunship's weapons to make a last stand alongside his soldiers. \n\nHe was ultimately killed when the helicopter was shot down and crashed into a nearby building. An LMB squad later recovered his sidearm [[Colonel Bliss's Holster|holster]] from the wreckage, seeking to commemorate their fallen leader.\n\n\n\n=== ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'' ===\nPrior to the outbreak, Bliss was scheduled to speak at a seminar titled \"''Shaping the Future of Warfare: How Private Sector Business Leads to Greater Outcomes\"'' in Washington, D.C.. The event was partly sponsored by the LMB, and would have been attended by then-Speaker of the House [[President Ellis|Andrew Ellis]] and [[Charles Douglas]], the co-founder of [[Douglas & Harding]]. Six months later, flyers advertising the seminar could still be found throughout the D.C. area.\n\n== Personality ==\nPsychologically, Charles Bliss had an uncompromising sense of duty, honor, and loyalty. Bliss held a deep love for his troops, both in the military and the LMB, which earned their unwavering respect and devotion in turn. Despite having the chance to flee New York or pursue revenge against Keener, Bliss instead chose to stay and help his men defend their territory. However, he had no such qualms about oppressing civilians or enforcing martial law, believing in achieving \"peace through strength\" and creating a new world where only the strongest would survive.\n\nAlthough Bliss was a man of his word and did not break oaths lightly, he chose to dump his Wall Street clients when it became apparent they were motivated purely by greed and self-interest. He was also quick to anger when others did not repay his trust in kind, particularly when Aaron Keener abandoned the LMB in its darkest hour.\n\n\n== Other Media ==\n===''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad'' ===\n*Charles Bliss was featured in ''Tom Clancy's Elite Squad'' as part of the Last Man Battalion faction.

China is known to have widely use the crossbow, ranging from the Warring States period (475-221 BC) to around the fall of the Han Dynasty (206-220 AD), where it started to lose its popularity. In Europe, the earliest record of the crossbow was around late 5th century BC when Greek author Heron of Alexandria described the ''gastraphetes'', a Greek made crossbow that was the forerunner to the catapult.\n{{Clear}}\nWhen compared to the bow and arrow, the crossbow can hold the tension from the draw for longer. In addition, the crossbow can be more widely used between troops, where the bow requires special training and skill in order to effectively use it. However, the crossbow is bulkier, making it heavier and slower to load it.\n\nToday, the crossbow is mainly use for hunting or competition sports, where firearms have widely replaced its use in combat.\n\n\n==Overview==\nThe crossbow is a unique signature weapon that players can access once activating the [[Survivalist (Specialization)|Survivalist Specialization]] upon reaching the endgame. It is an explosive weapon similar to the Demolitionist's [[M32A1 Multi-shot Grenade Launcher]], although players can land bolts directly onto enemies, which requires precise aiming like the Sharpshooter's [[TAC-50 C Rifle]].\n\nIt is a ballistic weapon, which requires leading moving targets in order to land shots. If bolts land directly on the enemy, they will be temporarily stunned until the bolt detonates. The armor-piercing bolts can penetrate robotic enemies, causing direct damage to Warhounds with every shot without having to break their defenses. The bolts can also break off armor of an enemy if it was a direct hit to the armor piece.\n\n\n==Appearance==\nAll crossbows come equipped with Ballistic Crossbow sights and a compartment that holds spare explosive bolts.

She is featured in various promotional material for [[Tom Clancy's The Division 2|''Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2'']] and is a protagonist\u00a0of ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis|Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division: Extremis Malis]]''.\n\nAfter the outbreak of [[Green Poison]], Ward joined the [[Camden Settlement]] in New Jersey and helped defend it from attacks by hostile factions. She eventually formed a cell alongside agents [[Caleb Dunne]] and [[Brian Johnson]].\n\n== Biography==\nWard once studied law with the goal of becoming an entertainment lawyer. After a friend was killed in a botched hostage negotiation, she instead decided to join the FBI\u2019s Critical Incident Response Group. She later obtained a PhD in Psychology at Georgetown University, where her thesis on the \u201cCatastrophic Mindset\u201d attracted the attention of the [[Strategic Homeland Division]]. She was eventually recruited by\u00a0agent [[Brenda Wells]].\n\nDuring the outbreak, Ward helped defend the [[Camden Settlement]] alongside three other Division agents and helped provide food by hunting wild turkeys in the spring. In February 2016, the settlement was accosted by the [[Founders]], a local paramilitary group, who began demanding weekly tributes of supplies in exchange for upholding \"security\". After Ward refused their offer, they returned with a mortar and machine guns and began a months-long string of attacks against the settlement. While the residents managed to fend them off, the Founders would always return, stronger and better armed each time. By March, Ward was the only agent remaining.\n\nAt around the same time, a young member named [[Timmy]] defected from the Founders and sought to join the settlement. Agent Ward took him in, initially believing he was a spy whom she could feed false intel, but Timmy eventually proved himself trustworthy, although he continued to regret his past--something Ward had intended to discuss with him.\n\n\n=== ''Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis'' ===\nA month later, Ward encountered Division agent [[Caleb Dunne]], who had come to Philadelphia searching for a woman who had murdered his partner [[Mathias Kaminsky]]. After fighting off an attack by the Founders together, Ward introduced him to Timmy. Upon hearing Dunne's physical description, Timmy identified the woman as \"[[Mantis]],\" who had previously visited the Founders' headquarters at Independence Hall. At Ward's insistence, he reluctantly agreed help them infiltrate the compound under cover of night.\n\nInside, they killed a member of the Fathers, but found no trace of Mantis. Dunne recovered a SATCOM receiver while Ward and Timmy planted explosive charges in the armory until the Founders detected them and sounded an alarm. The agents destroyed the armory and extracted to the sewers, but Timmy was shot and killed in the escape. Ward resisted the urge to blame Dunne for Timmy's death and acknowledged that his sacrifice saved many more people, but that it would still haunt her for the rest of her life.  With the Camden Settlement no longer in immediate danger, Ward decided to accompany Dunne to [[Fort Meade]] and attempt to decrypt the recovered transceiver.\n\nIn Maryland, they met agent [[Brian Johnson]], who joined their cell. The three agents bonded and recuperated for several weeks, until the NSA tracked Mantis' signal a farm outside Fredrick. The team killed Mantis's [[Black Tusk]] soldiers and destroyed Mantis' escape vehicle. Dunne overpowered Mantis and began choking her to death in a rage, only relenting at Ward's insistence.\n\nAs they detained Mantis, the [[SHD Network]] went offline, and their watches displayed the coordinates \u201c''[[D.C. Base of Operations|38.8975, -77.0375]]''\u201d. The trio then escorted Mantis to the nearby Fort Detrick, only to find it destroyed. A Black Tusk sniper then shot Mantis through the head and departed.\n\nHer cell subsequently followed their watch coordinates to [[Washington, D.C.]], where they arrived two weeks later.\n\n\n=== ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'' ===\nWhen Aaron Keener and the [[Cleaners]] resurfaced at [[Coney Island]], Ward left Washington, D.C. and traveled to New York alongside Dunne and Johnson. \n\n\n=== ''Tom Clancy's The Division: Hunted'' ===\nWard eventually relocated to Houston, Texas, the location of the SHD\u2019s [[Texas Core]]. Two weeks after the facility was attacked by Black Tusk, Ward contacted Brenda Wells and regretfully informed her that Black Tusk had been aided by [[Maira Kanhai]] - a former Division agent who been reported killed-in-action. Shocked that Kanhai was alive and refusing to believe she\u2019d gone rogue, Brenda led her cell to Houston in search of their former comrade.\n\n\n== Personality ==\nHeather Ward is a relentless optimist and an excellent reader of individuals' motivations; after meeting [[Caleb Dunne]], she immediately deduced that his pursuit of [[Mantis]] was part of a personal grudge, and reminded him that their goal was to capture and interrogate her, not to kill. She was also able to exploit [[Timmy]]'s guilt about his past with the [[Founders]] to secure his cooperation, although she felt guilty doing it - even more so after his death, which she acknowledged would haunt her for the rest of her life.\n\nAmong her teammates, Ward is the most sensitive to the emotional well-being of the others. She was instrumental in convincing Caleb Dunne to forego his revenge and spare Mantis's life. After the attack on the Texas Core, she was also reluctant to inform [[Brenda Wells]] about [[Maira Kanhai]]'s death, as she knew it would devastate Wells to learn that her former disciple had not only been abandoned in the Gulf Coast, but possibly gone [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue]] to work with [[Black Tusk]].\n\n\n==Equipment==\n*In promotional trailers for ''Tom Clancy's The Division 2'', Ward carries a [[Vector/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Vector SBR .45 ACP]] with an attached [[Muzzle|Osprey .45 Suppressor]], a [[Tactical .308]] with an attached [[Optic|VX-1 Scope (12x)]] and [[Muzzle|SR-7 Suppressor]], an [[LVOA-C]], and a [[M32A1 Multi-shot Grenade Launcher]].

He is a protagonist in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Broken Dawn]]''.\n\nFollowing the deaths of his family during the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] of [[Green Poison]], Ronson secretly betrayed the [[Strategic Homeland Division]] and became a double agent for [[Black Tusk]]. He was tasked with intercepting [[April Kelleher]] and securing samples of [[Broad-Spectrum Antiviral|broad-spectrum antivirals]].\n\n==Biography==\nA native of New Jersey, Ronson was the father of three children from a previous marriage. During the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] of [[Green Poison]] in [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]], he was activated as part of [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division's]] Second Wave. His girlfriend and one of his children died from infection; his ex-wife and two surviving children were later murdered by the [[Cleaners]].\n\nTheir loss shook Ronson\u2019s faith in the [[Joint Task Force]] and Strategic Homeland Division. When an intermediary introduced him to an operative named [[Mantis]], he was swayed by her promise of a new, stronger America and agreed to become a double agent for her employers (later revealed as [[Black Tusk]]). She then provided him electronic countermeasures to prevent [[ISAC]] from marking him as a [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Agent]].\n\n\n===''Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division: Extremis Malis''===\nAfter tracking Mantis to the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant, Division agent [[Caleb Dunne]] witnessed her talking with Ronson, who offered to track down Dunne for disrupting her partnership with the [[Last Man Battalion]]. Dunne was puzzled that Ronson's [[Smart Watch]] was still glowing orange, despite having clearly gone rogue. \n\n\n===''Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division: Broken Dawn''===\nSix weeks after their initial meeting, Mantis contacted Ronson with a mission to intercept April Kelleher, who had left Manhattan and was on her way to Ann Arbor, Michigan. Torn between following Kelleher and assisting in a JTF operation, Ronson decided to draw the hostiles away from the JTF before calling for backup and leaving, allowing another agent to finish the job. This resulted in fourteen civilian deaths; their bodies were discovered by another agent, [[Aurelio Diaz]], who\u00a0vowed to find Ronson. \n\nRonson left New York and pursued Kelleher with help from Mantis, delivering updates every forty-eight hours. During his journey, he also diverted from his mission in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania to help the local JTF recover stolen explosives. Outside of Milan, he caught up with Kelleher and rescued her from several escaped convicts, earning her trust. He lied to Kelleher about being deployed around Ohio and Pennsylvania and escorted her to the University of Michigan, where they met Diaz.  \n\nKelleher told the agents about her [[Bill Kelleher|husband]]'s research on broad-spectrum antivirals--a potential cure for the Green Poison that had been produced in the school's lab facilities. Diaz feigned ignorance about Ronson's identity, but Ronson was not deceived; while Kelleher slept, he invited Diaz to kill him if he truly believed Ronson had gone rogue.   \n\nThe next day, Ronson relayed the news to Mantis, who assembled a Black Tusk strike force nearby. The trio met with Dr. [[Kavita Chandrasekhar]] at the university labs; Ronson signaled to begin the assault, only to discover the antivirals had been sent to [[Washington, D.C.]] at the request of [[Andrew Ellis|President Ellis]].   \n\nShortly after, Diaz knocked Ronson unconscious and bound him to a chair with extension cords. He revealed Ronson's betrayal to the group, took the double agent's Smart Watch, and escaped with Kelleher as Black Tusk forces raided the lab. Ronson's fate thereafter is unknown.  \n\n== Personality ==\nAlthough he was ultimately a traitor to the Strategic Homeland Division, treachery did not come naturally to Ike Ronson. Instead, he constantly sought ways to internally rationalize his betrayal of the JTF and The Division as still working for the greater good, or dwell on how they had failed his family during the outbreak. Ronson also felt a lingering sense of responsibility towards the JTF and his fellow agents, which led to him resorting to half-measures that ultimately served no one - most notably, abandoning several civilians mid-evacuation in the confidence that another Division asset would arrive to save them, which instead led to their deaths and his eventual undoing at the hands of fellow agent Aurelio Diaz.\n\nRonson also held himself to high moral standards, and refused to take a shoot-first approach even if it was permitted under [[Directive 51]]. As he pursued April Kelleher on Mantis's orders, Ronson still took detours to aid those in need, such as helping the JTF retrieve stolen explosives at the Delaware Water Gap and even putting himself at risk to avoid needless casualties and save an infant in the process. He justified this as maintaining his cover by avoiding potential JTF complaints of unhelpful Division agents to his superiors. News of his good deeds even caused Agent Diaz to briefly second-guess his assessment of Ronson and whether he had misjudged him for a rogue agent.\n\nHowever, Ronson truly did believe that Black Tusk's brand of authoritarianism was the best way to re-establish order in a floundering post-pandemic society, even if it came at the cost of countless innocent lives. Although he made several attempts to justify his actions to Kelleher and Diaz, he was unable to convince anyone but himself.\n\n== Equipment ==\n\n* In ''Tom Clancy's The Division: Broken Dawn'', Ronson carries an [[M4]] and an unspecified sidearm.\n** On the book's cover, he also carries a [[G28]] with a [[Optic|Rugged Mini Reflex Sight]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In his initial appearance in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis]]'', Ronson wears his Smart Watch on his right arm. However, on the cover of ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Broken Dawn]]'', he wears it on his left.\n\n\n==Appearances== \n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Broken Dawn]]''\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis]]''\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:The Division]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Black Tusk]]\n[[Category:Rogue Agents]]",

Colonel [[Charles Bliss]], a highly decorated former officer in the United States Army's Special Forces, the LMB comprised almost entirely of former operators from the Army's premier light infantry unit, the 75th Ranger Regiment and the CIA's much feared Special Operations Group, the LMB employs some of the most highly trained and lethal mercenary contractors in the world. \n\nJust before the [[Green Poison]] outbreak broke out, the company had been contracted to numerous classified black sites across Western Asia and North Africa, often on the behalf of the United States government. But as the situation in New York rapidly deteriorated, panicked Wall Street financial firms immediately hired the LMB to protect their servers and high-value physical assets stored onsite in their [[Lower Manhattan]] vaults. Already exhausted from their hazardous overseas duty, the company was unprepared for their new deployment into the viral maelstrom of the deadliest urban catastrophe in modern history. \n\nCut off from their clients and caught badly unprepared for the outbreak, Bliss reluctantly formed an uneasy alliance with remaining elements of the JTF, offering his manpower in exchange for badly needed supplies to sustain their operations. Despite the occasional fraternizations between both organizations, the situation in New York continued to rapidly spiral out of control. Frustrated with the apparent indecision of JTF leadership and hamstrung heavily by ludicrous restrictions that prevented the LMB from securing the Financial District fully, the LMB's tenacious situation virtually collapsed when the JTF established the Dark Zone and pulled back to their main base of operations in Midtown.\n\nAs the LMB fought viciously in the streets for days in a battle for survival, Bliss became convinced that only the LMB had the means and determination to retake and secure New York from the chaos that plagued the city. Upon securing the Financial District, Bliss implemented martial law throughout the district, often press-ganging civilians living in the district to join the ranks of the badly depleted LMB. Recognizing the JTF's reluctance to condone their former allies' intentions, Bliss met up with their JTF liaison in a bid to convince them to assist the LMB. However, as the meeting grew heated, Bliss executed the liaison and permanently severed ties with the crippled-JTF. \n\nContrasting to other major factions in Manhattan, the LMB employed far more combat specialists with top-grade military gear and weapons, and their defensive positions were more heavily fortified. As much of their equipment was lost or destroyed in the heavy street-fighting in the early days of the pandemic, occasional expeditions were sent into the Dark Zone, with the intent of recovering large quantities of still-functioning equipment left behind by the JTF during their hasty retreat from the quarantine zones. \n\nConvinced that not just the city but the entire nation would collapse in the atavistic wake of the pandemic, Bliss was determined that his LMB would survive the smallpox, seize full control of New York, and then use their newly created city-state as a base to usher in a new world order - one where only those with strength of will and character survive.\n{{Clear}}\n=== A Rogue Alliance ===\nAs expeditions were sent into the Dark Zones to secure much-needed supplies, many such units encountered a number of surviving Division agents left behind during the evacuation of the Zone. With many of these agents cut off and declared rogue, most opted to join the LMB, recognising the PMC as their only hope for survival. One such agent was Aaron Keener, who after a meeting with Bliss, led to another uneasy alliance, which allowed the LMB to gain access to classified Division tech, in exchange for the LMB's manpower for the Rogue Agents' uses. This alliance was based on the idea that current political systems would be incapable of maintaining stable societies in a harsh post-pandemic world. Keener shared Bliss's vision of a grim Darwinian future. The resulting alliance led to several of Keener's crew becoming LMB field commanders. \n\nAs Keener became aware of the activation of Second Wave agents into Manhattan, Keener notified Bliss, who authorized Keener's usage of an LMB surface-to-air missile to eliminate the Division agents, in the hopes of destabilizing the remaining JTF in the city. Their efforts proved successful, as the attack killed the bulk of the Second Wave, including its Senior Commander, [[Louis Chang]]. However, unbeknownst to the duo, several Division Agents had survived the horrific attack and were instead recovered by an arriving JTF medical crew, eventually arriving at Camp Hudson to begin their campaign to retake the city. \n\nUpon their recovery of their Base of Operations, Division agents learned about the LMB's involvement in the attack and quickly considered them to be the most formidable hostile force operating in New York. Concurrently, as the attack occurred, Bliss successfully hammered out cooperative agreements with other factions, including the [[Cleaners]] and [[Rikers]], agreeing to leave their respective factions to their domain and occasionally cooperating in excursions to the Dark Zone.\n\n\n=== The Battalion Collapses ===\nDespite these ominous developments, [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]] managed to shatter the mercenary company thanks to the efforts of its crack corps of Second Wave agents. These agents proved to be highly resourceful and displayed remarkable adaptability to hostile, deteriorating urban environments. As their efforts grew increasingly successful in spite of overwhelming odds, these agents began setting new standards for Division field operations and their successes confirmed the efficacy of Division training and, in fact, of the entire concept of \"stay-behind\" operations. As the major factions including Cleaners and Rikers were wiped out, plans were initiated to counter LMB operations. Upon invading the Financial District and carrying out numerous successful operations, the LMB were forced back to their HQ in the former United Nations building. As the combined Division-JTF task force assaulted their HQ, the LMB found themselves abandoned by their rogue compatriots. Seeking revenge on Keener, but unwilling to abandon his men, Bliss made a last-ditch attempt to eliminate the combined task force and retake his base. Despite his best efforts, Bliss was ultimately killed by The Division, who eventually eliminated the last remaining LMB resistance in their HQ.\n\nWith the collapse of virtually the entirety of its commanding hierarchy, the PMC collapsed. Scattering into isolated units, many of these remaining units no longer posed a major threat to the JTF. Yet, weeks after this enormous setback, the surviving elements of the LMB rallied under the command of Captain Perez in their [[Falcon Lost|underground base]] in an attempt to wipe out The Division with their sole remaining APC. As JTF forces mounted an assault against their underground fortress, the ill-equipped attackers were wiped out quickly prior to the arrival of Division Agents. Despite this, the Division Agents continued proving adaptive, and successfully planted numerous explosives across the APC, resulting in the deaths of Captain Perez and his underground garrison.\n\nAs the JTF began retaking much of Manhattan, surviving forces of each major factions formed a temporary truce at the West Side Piers, seeking to eliminate the encroaching Division and JTF forces. Through unknown means, LMB units established contact with the Hunters, several of whom agreed to join temporary coalition in exchange for eliminating Division agents. Their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful as Division agents persevered against overwhelming odds, fragmenting the factions for the duration. \n\n\n=== Fragmentation and Resurgence ===\nAfter the JTF solidified its hold over Manhattan, several surviving LMB units opted to join with them, in exchange for pardons for their previous crimes. During this period, these newly established units were re-deployed back to the Financial District, serving as the garrison for an outpost based in Wall Street. Yet despite the defections, enough manpower remained that the JTF considered them a potent threat. The Black Tusk, seeking to undermine the JTF's foothold over New York City, covertly supplied the LMB with large shipments of weapons, including the MANPAD Carl Gustav's. However, as casualties mounted, the remnants of the once-powerful PMC were forcibly recruited into the Black Tusk, finally dissolving the Last Man Battalion. \n\nIn contrast, the JTF defectors were wiped out as Aaron Keener returned to New York City, leading his new unit of Rogue agents reinforced by resurgent Rikers and Cleaner factions. \n\n\n== Intelligence Brief ==\n[[File:LMBIntelligenceBrief.jpg|thumb|right|378x378px]]Worn and battle-weary, the LMB were none too pleased being recalled from overseas and diverted to [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]]. With their requests for transfer gone unheeded and extraction, not an option, this PMC has become trapped far from home in the worst area of the epidemic. Tired of indecisive local authorities, their commander, [[Charles Bliss]], took matters into his own hands, disobeying direct orders and executing a [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] official\u2014effectively turning his entire company and himself into mutineers.\n\nConvinced not just the city, but the nation, will collapse under the hopeless burden of the [[Green Poison|virus]], the LMB has no allegiance to anyone but themselves. They will use any and all means necessary to make sure they make it through the storm and to usher in a new world order where only the strong will survive.\n{{Clear}}\n== Named Members ==\n{{LMB HVT}}\n\n\n== Relationships with other organizations ==\nAs the dominant military force in [[New York City]] prior to the activation of the Second Wave of [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents, most major factions sought to actively avoid conflict with the LMB. With its disciplined and technologically advanced fighting force, alongside major [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue]] First Wave agents in their ranks, the LMB locked down the entirety of the [[Financial District]], as skirmishes and conflicts within their territory became limited to those from [[Rioters]]. However, despite the LMB's open antagonism with other factions, the PMC has been noted for its willingness to establish the occasional alliance and truce with other major factions.\n\nDuring the initial [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] of the [[Green Poison]], the LMB held a neutral view of the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]], having come to rely upon the organization for much-needed supplies. However, their view of the JTF soon turned sour following major missteps and arguments regarding the rules of engagement. The mutually beneficial relationship collapsed shortly after the JTF erected the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]] and abandoned the LMB in the Financial District and was permanently severed following [[Charles Bliss|Colonel Bliss]]' execution of their JTF liaison. As the JTF further withdrew from frequent attacks from other major factions, attacks on JTF outposts and patrols decreased as the LMB deemed the JTF as insignificant. However, as the Second Wave of agents were activated, the LMB's attacks on encroaching JTF patrols increased, culminating into the JTF's takeover of the Financial District. Bitter over the loss of its HQ, isolated pockets of LMB units repeatedly sought to eliminate the JTF and Division forces, eventually culminating into two major attempts to eliminate both factions through surprise offensives.\n\nThe LMB is shown to be getting [[Carl Gustav M3 RPG|Carl Gustav]]'s and other heavy armaments supplied by the [[Black Tusks|Black Tusk]]\u00a0to keep the JTF and agents busy in Manhattan after Colonel Bliss's death, as shown in the comic ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis|Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis.]]''\n\nConversely, the LMB views the [[Cleaners]] and [[Rikers]] as a more legitimate threat, although it is unknown who they think is the bigger threat among the two. One LMB report shows two LMB soldiers disagreeing with each on who they think is stronger. One of them believes the Rikers are stronger because they are filled with dangerous criminals and have access to an array of weapons. The other believes the Cleaners are stronger because of their flamethrowers and their fanatical discipline makes them unable to feel fear.\n\nAny animosity they have with the other factions would have likely been resolved by the time of\u00a0[[Resistance]]\u00a0as they joined forces with remnants of the\u00a0Rioters,\u00a0Rikers,\u00a0Cleaners, and [[Hunters]]\u00a0to combat the JTF and Division agents as well as to hunt down [[Aaron Keener]].\n\n\n== Weapons Used ==\n{{Template:LMB Weapons}}\n\n\n== LMB Archetype ==\n{{Template:LMB Class}}\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe LMB are some of the toughest AI enemies that the player will encounter in [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]]. Their ranks can range from Lvl 20-30, and above 31 in the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]]. Engaging groups of LMB soldiers on the same level, or higher than the player is not recommended unless the player is accompanied by group members, as they will be able to make short work of the player.\n\nSnipers will act like any other sniper unit, staying back and attempting to pick the player off from a distance. Some Elite Snipers have an under barrel-mounted laser/strobe device that can blind the player during engagements, such as the first sniper encountered in [[General Assembly]]. They also throw shock mines that will stun the player if tripped. Unlike snipers from other factions, LMB snipers are sometimes outfitted with sub-machine guns instead of pistols for use at close range.\n\nRiflemen use assault rifles and flashbang or stun grenades to assault the player. These are the most common LMB soldier encountered. A common tactic used by Riflemen is to flank the players while they are distracted by other LMB soldiers.\n\nScouts will run up as close to the player as possible, like the [[Rikers]], and use a semi-automatic shotgun. When playing on Hard or Challenging, or if too low in level, multiple Scouts can easily wipe out teams of Agents.\n\nGunners act like other AI heavy gunners, they normally have heavy armor, and can sometimes be seen using riot shields. LMB Gunners are the only Heavy-type enemy to appear as regular enemies, rather than only as Veteran (purple) or Named Elite (gold) rank enemies.\n\nGrenadiers will use a grenade launcher, instead of hand grenades, which allows them to fire multiple grenades at a time instead of one like other enemies will do.\n\nEngineers will deploy turrets that are much stronger than those of the [[Cleaners]] and will repair them when damaged.\n\nMedics will deploy support stations to heal nearby LMB soldiers, as well as themselves, and move to repair their stations once they are damaged. On Hard or Challenging difficulty, Medics should be primary targets if no Scouts are present. Their support stations will constantly heal all LMB soldiers, and if there is even one Medic left, they will repair the damaged station or place down another one if destroyed.\n\nThe LMB, due to their connection with Aaron Keener, is also known for having rogue First Wave agents at their disposal, capable of using similar tech and abilities as the agents that fight against the Battalion, such as turrets, seeker mines, and the likes. They are also capable of hacking any Second Wave agents' equipment such as their own turrets, and mines, to the LMB's advantage.\n\nIn New York, The Black Tusk is revealing to be supplying the\u00a0Last Man Battalion\u00a0with Carl Gustav's and other heavy armaments as shown in the comic\u00a0''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis|Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis.]]''\n\n\n== Branches ==\nUnlike the other factions in ''Tom Clancy's The Division'', the LMB is the only faction that has multiple branches.\n\n=== Rank I ===\nThe most common LMB type seen around the city. They can be identified by their white clothing, black vests, and white ski masks.\n\n=== Rank II ===\nRank II LMB soldiers are seen in some of the last missions and incursions, usually used for defensive reasons. They can be identified by their solid black clothing and face masks. They do more damage than their Rank I counterparts and have access to tactical grenades.\n\n=== Special Forces, or Rank III ===\nLMB soldiers that are only seen on missions set on Legendary Difficulty. They have the same look as their Rank II counterparts, only with a light grey vest instead of solid black. They don't have an enemy level; instead, a shield symbol is behind their archetype symbol, indicating that they have the highest amount of damage and health.\n\nLegendary missions usually start with a squad of LMB SF on regular difficulty, but after they're killed all LMB SF encountered from that point on are encountered as Elite.\n\n\n== Final Boss ==\nThe final boss fight is fought at the United Nations building. The player must fight the LMB leader, Charles Bliss, who uses a UH-60 Black Hawk military helicopter armed with miniguns and rocket pods.\n\nIn order to do sufficient damage to Bliss, the player must manually activate the six turrets encountered earlier that are spread out around the courtyard. The turrets will begin firing at the helicopter, but after about 10\u201315 seconds of fire Bliss will destroy the turret with rockets. The helicopter will fire its miniguns at the player, which will put the player in a bleed-out state in a matter of seconds. The helicopter will also use its rocket pods to target a player and barrage the area they are in, acting much like Grenadiers. Once the bosses armor bar is at about half, LMB soldiers will begin pouring out of the U.N. building to engage the player; these will normally consist of Riflemen and Scouts but can include Medics as well.\n\nAfter the helicopter is damaged to the point of its health being below 25%, it will catch on fire. Upon the health bar reaching 0%, the helicopter will crash into the nearby building to the south of the courtyard, killing Bliss on impact. After the remaining LMB soldiers are killed four items of superior rarity will drop around the helicopter crash site.\n\nUntil Update 1.1, this boss fight marked the last \"major\" boss fight in the game, and up until Update 1.2 that title belonged to the APC in [[Falcon Lost]]. As of 1.2., The last \"major\" boss fight in the game now belongs to the Firetruck, Dubbed \"Dragon One\" by the cleaners In [[Dragon's Nest]].\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\nThe Last Man Battalion mans nineteen known permanent fortifications in the Light Zone, located within the districts of [[Murray Hill]], [[Turtle Bay]], and [[Midtown East]]. There are four known types of fortification: \n*Gates, which line the LMB's southern border, giving control over access into their territory; \n*Checkpoints, which are small outposts located within LMB territory to control civilian traffic; \n*Camps, which are larger areas housing LMB troops for various purposes;\n*Ops Bases, which are the central locations for command, control, and logistics for the Last Man Battalion.\n**{{Exotic|Murray Hill:}}\n***Gate Alfa, Intersection of 36th Street and Park Avenue.\n***Gate Bravo, located at the intersection of 36th Street and 3nd Avenue.\n***Gate Charlie, located at the intersection of 36th Street and 2nd Avenue.\n***Gate Delta, located at the intersection of 38th Street and 1st Avenue.\n***Gate Echo, located at the intersection of 39th Street and 1st Avenue.\n***Unknown Camp, built in and around the [[Queens Tunnel Camp|Queens Tunnel]].\n****Forms a large part of the LMB's southern border, its fortifications preventing crossover in much of the LMB's territory. Due to its size and fortifications, it is presumably an Ops Base.\n***Camp Lee, [INSERT LOCATION HERE ONCE FOUND.]\n**{{Exotic|Turtle Bay:}} \n***Ops Base Sheridan, built around the [[United Nations HQ|UN Building]].\n***Ops Base Grant, built in and around [[Grand Central Terminal]].\n***Camp Ross, built in and around the Vale Arms Hotel at the intersection of 41st Street and 3rd Avenue.\n***Camp Freeman, built around an office building at 46th Street and 7th Avenue.\n**{{Exotic|Midtown East:}}\n***Camp Washington, built in and around the UDBG bank and the Electrical Goods Store at the intersection of 56th Street and Madison Avenue.\n***Camp MacArthur, built around a hotel at the intersection of 49th Street and 5th Avenue.\n***Camp Adams, built around the Church at the intersection 53rd Street and Park Avenue.\n\n\n== Quotes ==\n<tabber>Rifleman=\n*''Contact!

While they are absolutely ruthless, they mostly believe they are doing the right thing and, in some cases, they seemingly have more success than the JTF. Their strict rules are oppressive, but the civilians in the LMB territory are generally far safer from Rioters, Rikers, and Cleaners than civilians in some of the JTF controlled areas. One phone recording of two rioters talking reveals that they are far more afraid of the LMB, opting to risk facing the JTF instead, whom they consider to be soft and less deadly. The civilians are safe due to the LMB's patrols and checkpoints all throughout their territory, with virtually no presence from other factions.  On the other hand, the LMB does little to improve the living conditions of the civilians in their territory. Being a militaristic organization, most of their assets and knowledge are focused on the strategic and tactical side. While the JTF draws from police, military, medical, engineering, and maintenance organizations, the LMB has done little recruiting at all from the population, possibly because few want to live under their rule or they do not trust civilians. The engineering and medical resources that they do possess are dedicated entirely on their military mission. This makes the LMB very combat effective, but means any civilians have to do without.\n**If a civilian comes to close to a patrol, they will issue a verbal warning for the civilian to back away. If the civilian moves away, the soldiers will not shoot; but if the civilian comes closer, they will shoot and kill the civilian. \n*If the player purchases the LMB Faction Bundle from the Premium Vendor, they will get the Rifleman outfit.\n**Players can earn parts of this bundle from doing [[Incursions]], as well as [[missions]] that have Heroic difficulty.\n*The LMB is shown to be getting supplied by the [[Black Tusks|Black Tusk]]\u00a0to keep the JTF and agents busy in Manhattan after Bliss's death, as shown in the comic ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis|Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis.]]''\n*According to a State of the Game podcast a portion of the LMB were absorbed into Black Tusk and will provide Black Tusk with new archetypes. These will include [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MojqMQ2UsYo&t=2384s Rushers] (timestamp 26:25) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MojqMQ2UsYo&t=2384s Supports] (timestamp 28:11).\n*A portion of the LMB is shown to have joined the JTF after Bliss's death according to the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yZVmNQXob4 Animated Short for The Warlords of New York]. LMB Riflemen, Rushers, and Squad Leaders are wearing JTF letters on their apparel now. They are no longer using the color scheme of red, white, and black.

Of the pistol-type sidearms, it has the highest damage per shot and can be fitted with a magazine and underbarrel mod, in exchange for having very high recoil and a small magazine.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe M1911 is a pistol of US origin. It was developed in the early 1900's by John Browning and produced by Colt. The M1911 became a famous pistol that served with US forces in both World Wars. Despite its age it remains in use today. Over the years many derivatives have been developed.\n\nThe M1911 is a short recoil operated single action pistol. It is made out metal, except for the grip plates. The M1911 fires the .45 ACP round that was specifically designed for this pistol.\n\nThe M1911 fires the .45 ACP round from a 7 round single magazine. The M1911 fires semi-automatic only and has an effective range of 50 meters. Many versions and derivatives of the M1911 have been developed. Most retain the .45 caliber and 7 round magazine, but various high capacity models and variants in other calibers exist.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n*M1911\n*Tactical M1911\n*M45A1\n*{{Exotic|Centurion}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" columns=\"dynamic\" widths=\"170\">\nM1911.png|M1911\nTactical M1911.png|Tactical M1911\nM45A1.png|M45A1\nCenturion.png|{{Exotic|Centurion}}\n</gallery>\n\n{{Nav/Weapons}}\n\n[[es:M1911]]\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Sidearms]]\n[[Category:The Division]]",

It is considered a seminal self-loading handgun, using the force of a fired round to eject the spent cartridge and load another. In the era of revolvers, its design was revolutionary, and elements like its short recoil operation, thumb safety, and powerful .45 ACP cartridge became the basis for nearly all centerfire pistols throughout the next century. \n\nThe '''Tactical M1911''' and '''M45A1''' are modeled after the newer '''M45 MEUSOC''' and its '''CQB''' variant, respectively - updated designs produced for the U.S. Marine Corps, featuring improvements like dual recoil springs and an attachment rail.\n\n==Usage==\nThe '''M1911''' is an accurate and decently powerful Sidearm, occupying a middle ground between faster-firing pistols like the '''[[X-45/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|X-45]]''' and hand cannons like the '''[[D50]]'''. It's perfectly capable of finishing off an enemy when an agent's Primary Weapon runs dry, but the small magazine capacity and high damage falloff makes missed shots hurt more than with lower-caliber handguns. \n\nFor use in dedicated Pistol builds, such as when paired with a [[Ballistic Shield/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Ballistic Shield]], the '''Tactical M1911''' and '''M45A1''' variants are better choices for their additional attachment slots, which aid in scoring headshots and maximizing the damage of every bullet.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:M1911 Div2.png|thumb|200px|left]]\n===M1911===\nAn American classic, the M1911 remains as reliable as ever.

She is an antagonist in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis]]'' and a supporting character in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Broken Dawn]]''.\n\nMantis coordinated weapons shipments from various paramilitary groups across the eastern United States, as part of Black Tusk\u2019s proxy campaign against the [[Joint Task Force]] and [[Strategic Homeland Division]]. She also enlisted the aid of rogue agent [[Ike Ronson]] in an attempt to secure samples of [[Broad Spectrum Anti-Virals|broad-spectrum antivirals]] from Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\n==Biography==\nPrior to joining [[Black Tusk]], Linda Kaib served in the military as part of the U.S. Army Rangers. She was eventually listed as \u2018killed in action\u2019 by the Department of Defense, though her physical description and fingerprints match those of Mantis.\n\nFollowing the death of his family, Mantis contacted Ike Ronson via an intermediary and convinced him to become a double agent for her unknown employer. She then provided him electronic countermeasures that would prevent [[ISAC]] from marking him as a [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue]].\n\n\n===''Tom Clancy's The Division: Broken Dawn''===\nSix weeks after their initial meeting, Mantis contacted Ronson with a mission to intercept [[April Kelleher]], who had left Manhattan and was on her way to Ann Arbor, Michigan. This forced Ronson to abandon an ongoing [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] operation in [[New York City|New York]], resulting in fourteen civilian deaths. Their bodies were discovered by another agent [[Aurelio Diaz]], who vowed to find Ronson.\n\nMantis would check in with Ronson every forty-eight hours, updating him on Kelleher\u2019s progress. He eventually caught up outside Milan and accompanied her to the University of Michigan, where they met Diaz. Kelleher told the agents about her husband\u2019s research on broad-spectrum antivirals - a potential cure for the [[Green Poison]] that had been produced in the school's lab facilities. Ronson relayed the news to Mantis, who assembled a Black Tusk strike force nearby.\n\nRonson signaled to begin the assault, only to discover the antivirals had been sent to [[Washington, D.C.]] at the request of [[Andrew Ellis|President Ellis]]. Shortly after, Ronson was knocked unconscious by Diaz, who left him bound to a chair and escaped with Kelleher as Black Tusk forces raided the lab.\n\n\n===''Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division: Extremis Malis''===\nMantis coordinated shipments of heavy weapons to paramilitary groups across the East Coast, such as the remnants of the [[Last Man Battalion]], undermining the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] and [[Strategic Homeland Division|SHD]]\u2019s attempts to re-establish civil order. She kept numerous safe houses across various states, and met with clients both in-person and via radio.\n\nWith help from [[Padilla]], a civilian informant, the Division tracked Mantis to a warehouse in Chinatown. [[Faye Lau|Faye]] Lau sent agents [[Caleb Dunne]] and [[Mathias Kaminsky]] were sent to raid the location, with support from the JTF. Inside, the agents encountered Mantis, who feigned surrender and took Kaminsky hostage at knifepoint. She then slit his throat and stabbed him before escaping. Kaminsky died soon afterwards, prompting Dunne to swear revenge.\n\nMantis then assassinated Padilla at his apartment in Greenwich Village. His body was found by Dunne, who identified Mantis as the culprit via [[ECHO]]. Trace chemicals at the scene led Dunne to the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant, where he witnessed Mantis talking with rogue agent Ike Ronson. \n\nDunne found Mantis\u2019s safe house underground, which contained loose [[Smart Watch|SHD Smart Watches]] and a map detailing operations across the East Coast, including between New York City and Philadelphia. Mantis returned and, after a scuffle, activated the hideout\u2019s self-destruct explosives and fled. Dunne barely escaped, and was recovered by JTF personnel. \n\nAfter recovering, he left for Philadelphia, where he partnered with agent [[Heather Ward]]. At the Camden Settlement, a defector named [[Timmy]] informed the agents that Mantis was working with the [[Founders]], a local paramilitary group. The trio infiltrated their headquarters at Independence Hall, where they recovered a SATCOM transceiver and destroyed their armory with explosives. This forced Mantis to call [[Milla \"Wyvern\" Radek]] and report losing contact with both the Founders and LMB. She reassured her superior they still had enough assets to proceed, but Wyvern warned her that given the stakes at hand, anyone was expendable.\n\nWeeks later, [[National Security Agency|NSA]] technicians managed to trace the transceiver\u2019s signal to a farmhouse outside Fredrick, Maryland, where Mantis was stationed with a team of Black Tusk soldiers. Dunne, Ward and agent [[Brian Johnson]] arrived soon afterwards, prompting a firefight. Mantis attempted to escape in a Humvee, but Ward overturned her vehicle with a [[Sticky Bomb]]. Dunne overpowered Mantis and began choking her to death in a rage, only relenting at Ward\u2019s insistence. As they detained Mantis, the [[SHD Network]] went offline, and their watches displayed the coordinates \u201c''[[D.C. Base of Operations|38.8975, -77.0375]]''\u201d. \n\nThe agents escorted Mantis to the nearby [[Fort Detrick]] for interrogation, but found the entire base destroyed. On [[Milla \"Wyvern\" Radek|Wyvern]]\u2019s orders, a hidden Black Tusk sniper then shot Mantis through the head and fled, silencing her.

Kaminsky remarked that he never had the patience to create scale wooden ships the way his father did. \n\nFollowing the activation of [[Directive 51]], Kaminsky and his friend Caleb Dunne were both activated as part of The Division's First Wave. One of their first missions together was locating [[Padilla]], a \"fixer\" loosely associated with the [[Last Man Battalion]], who had severed ties with the [[Joint Task Force]] and been declared renegades.

Inside, he encountered a female operative, [[Mantis]], who feigned surrender before subduing Kaminsky and taking him hostage at knifepoint.  \n\nDunne shattered an office window and ordered Mantis to release Kaminsky, unwilling to risk shooting his partner. Instead, Mantis sliced Kaminsky's throat and stabbed him in the abdomen, then fled, leaving him bleeding on the floor. Despite Dunne's attempt to administer first aid, Kaminsky died shortly afterwards. \n\nAt the base of operations, Faye Lau attempted to console Dunne, who was struggling with survivor's guilt. Eventually, Dunne would leave New York for Philadelphia to pursue Mantis, seeking revenge for Kaminsky. \n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nKaminsky dunne photo.png|A photo of Mathias Kaminsky with [[Caleb Dunne]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division: Extremis Malis]]''\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:Division Agents]]\n[[Category:The Division: Extremis Malis]]",

Smart and organized, the True Sons consider themselves a territorial entity with a legitimate army. They seek to expand their influence, consolidate power, and suppress all rivals in the region.\n\nLed by a former JTF field commander named [[Antwon Ridgeway]], the True Sons are typical of a warlord-led faction in a conflict zone or failed state. Their ruthlessness and combat prowess make them a formidable force in the field. All [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents are advised to exercise extreme caution when undertaking unsupported actions against this adversary. \n\n==Background and Events==\nThe pandemic hit [[Washington, D.C.]] hard, killing many civilians and security forces alike. Despite field inoculations and other immune-support antiviral medications, some [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] units suffered more than seventy-five percent attrition from the [[Green Poison|smallpox]]. This spawned discontent in the surviving ranks. On January 10, 2016, Colonel [[Antwon Ridgeway]] of the Maryland National Guard was promoted to JTF field commander, southeast region, and given the rank of General following the death of his predecessor in a vehicular accident. Secretly disgusted with what he considered the excessive caution and timidity of JTF's chain of command - officers who issued orders from a disconnected bubble of safety within their fortified base of operations on [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]] grounds - General Ridgeway started taking increasingly aggressive and often lethal measures against insurgents, looters and even relatively benign protest crowds inside quarantine zones throughout January and into February. As a result, he earned repeated reprimands from JTF brass. He also diverted supplies meant for the Roosevelt Quarantine and CERA camps away from the camps for his troops. \n\nEventually, in late February, Ridgeway's cruel and egregious maltreatment of detainees in [[Roosevelt Island|Roosevelt]], the island quarantine encampment on the Potomac River, led to his downfall after murdering an unarmed civilian for breaking quarantine. Court martialed for insubordination, Ridgeway was stripped of his rank and imprisoned at JTF's make-shift detention area in the basement of the [[American History Museum]]. But after a short incarceration, he escaped (along with numerous other prisoners) thanks to help from loyal members of his former JTF unit lead by [[Ashford|Major Ashford]] and [[Keates|Captain Keates]].\n\nThis unit plus new followers freed from the stockade formed the core of a new faction, initially christened the \"True Sons of Liberty\" but soon shortened to just True Sons. Their first order of business was to kidnap several of the senior JTF officers responsible for Ridgeway's arrest, convene a tribunal to try them, and then summarily execute them.\n\nAs the True Sons faction grew, other militia groups in the D.C. area were either assimilated or eradicated. Thanks in part to their formal counterinsurgency training and military-grade weapons and gear, the True Sons quickly rose to a dominant position within D.C. proper. \n\nIn late March, Washington, D.C. begins to collapse from the uncontrollable pandemic and subsequent disasters with [[DC-62]]. [[President Mendez]]\u00a0orders the remaining government members including Speaker of the House, [[President Ellis|Andrew Ellis]] to evacuate the city. During this, General Ridgeway took advantage of the chaos and\u00a0storms\u00a0[[Capitol Building|The Capitol]], devastating the remaining loyal JTF except for those at based at\u00a0[[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]]. Additionally, the True Sons make the Capitol Building their stronghold, and begin to stockpile weapons, vehicles, and ordinance.\n\nThe Division strikes back at the True Sons in late May, overrunning the outpost at the Viewpoint Museum, commanded by Staff Sergeant Carl Wade, and destroying the capabilities of the True Sons prison at the American History Museum, commanded by Captain Briggs. Additionally, they cripple the True Sons missile factory at the Air and Space Museum, killing Lieutenant Kelly in the process. By this point, the True Sons and General Ridgeway begin to make preparations to strike back at the Division. In early June, Ridgeway makes the call to bomb the Castle Settlement with DC-62 for refusing to pay 'tribute' to the True Sons. All but seven residents are either killed by the chemicals, or are executed by the True Sons squad that sweeps the Castle following the blast. The Division storms Jefferson Plaza and the Space Administration Headquarters, destroying most stocks of the True Sons' DC-62 weapons. Additionally, they kill both Captain Wilson and Master Sergeant Steve Quiroz (also known as 'Junior'), crippling the True Sons control over South-West DC.\n\nThe True Sons begin one final attempt to force the Division into a surrender by taking over the Lincoln Memorial and threatening to bomb the Campus with DC-62 mortars. However, the Division storms the site, containing the remaining DC-62 mortars and killing both Majors Keates and Ashford - two of Ridgeway's closest allies.\n\nThe True Sons, seriously weakened, retreated back to their final stronghold in the [[Capitol Building]], where Division agents with the assistance of the remaining [[Joint Task Force]] and [[Civilian Militia]] assaulted the facility, killing both Lieutenant Simpson (also known as 'Doc') and Captain Kendra Nelson (Also know as 'Crazy Uncle Ken'). After sweeping through the complex, True Sons Leader, [[Antwon Ridgeway]], made his own appearance, giving one final attempt to thwart the assault.\n\nWith the death of Ridgeway, most high-ranking officers, and all operational bases, the True Sons have lost any discipline they once had and have collapsed into a scattered gang that attempts to horde resources, reorganize, and scare civilians into submission. Their overall goal - to survive in D.C. against all factions, including the [[Black Tusk]].\n\n\n== Leadership after the death of Ridgeway ==\n{{Quote|1=The True Sons are getting bolder under their new leader, General Anderson. He used to be a strategist for Ridgeway, and it looks like his ambition has reached new heights.|2=Agent Kelso describing the True Sons' command structure under General Anderson.}}When [[Operation Iron Horse|the foundry was captured]] by one of the only remaining True Sons officers - Colonel [[Morozova]], she finally gave the True Sons a point to rally around for revenge against The Division. They utilized the foundry and scavenged resources to build an armored train, miniguns, RPGs, and other prototype technology to give them the edge. However, with the death of Colonel [[Morozova]], the loss of the foundry, and the production line, the True Sons once again scattered over D.C. and the surrounding area.\n\nThe True Sons were dealt a further crippling blow with the loss of Linette 'Dusk' Edwards, whose connection to the Black Tusk had allowed the True Sons to regain some form of stability. In particular, it made in particular Sergeant Daniels hungry for revenge against the Division.\n\nThe True Sons finally re-emerged more than 1 month after the death of Faye Lau with a new leader, a new aim, and even greater ambition - to take control of America. [[General Anderson]], once a strategist for Ridgeway, now rebuilt the True Sons with the aid of [[Captain Lewis]]. Their goal by the end of Hidden Alliance is to get the Division to realize that they share a common enemy - Black Tusk and Calvin McManus. The True Sons have resurged in DC under Major [[Major Castillo|Castillo]], Sergeant [[Sergeant Daniels|Daniels]], Lieutenant [[Lieutenant Chang|Chang]], and Major [[Major Xander|Xander]]. The Division has once again mobilized to cripple the True Sons.\n\nGeneral Anderson, after the deaths of all four lieutenants and the resistance of the Division, has realized  that his troops are no match for the Division ''and'' the Black Tusk. He has succeeded in rebuilding at least part of the alliance between the Black Tusk and the True Sons that collapsed with the death of Linette Edwards, and has allied himself with the Black Tusk. However, this may cause trouble for the True Sons, as Captain Lewis in particular has shown extreme worry over where the True Sons are going.\n\nAnderson would begin plans to finalize their alliance by meeting with Natalya Sokolova at Pentco-Fairview Power Plant. Though Sokolova raised concerns with Anderson about Lewis' loyalty, Anderson brushed these off by assuring her that Lewis was loyal. His mind was later changed when Sokolova showed him a recording of Lewis speaking with Manny Ortega, with Sokolova encouraging Anderson to follow Lewis to see what he would do next. \n\nLewis would reach out to parley with Manny Ortega, as they had both served in the same JTF unit. Slowly, with the aid of plant engineer \"Wally\", Lewis built a force of True Sons who agreed with him, numbering around one hundred. However, Lewis' actions would be uncovered, and he would be captured alongside the majority of his supporters, although Wally escaped as she was on a supply mission at the time, eventually making her way to The Castle. \n\nThe Division would learn of Lewis's imprisonment, and looking to neutralize Anderson before the alliance was finalized, as well as rescue their new ally, launched an assault on the plant, engaging both True Sons and Black Tusk. Though Lewis was rescued, Anderson managed to escape, meeting with Sokolova and officially allying their two factions. It would be revealed that aside from Lewis and Wally, most if not all of the other rogue True Sons were dead or imprisoned. \n\n== Allies of the Black Tusk ==\nThe remaining True Sons under Anderson have since been working with the Black Tusk, first to assist [[Zachary \"Stovepipe\" Beattie|Stovepipe]]'s operations in D.C., and later to escort prisoners, though they have lost several officers at the hands of the Division, most notably being drone operator [[Lieutenant Bantam]] and sniper [[Beatrice \"Auntie\" Kaplan]]. Lewis himself would later be killed by a Hunter when the Black Tusk attacked The White House, with Wally continuing to aid the Division at The Castle. \n\nGeneral Anderson has not yet resurfaced, though it can be assumed he is laying low after his close call, and is continuing to lead the remaining True Sons. \n\nDuring the Black Tusk effort to apprehend \"[[Alani Kelso|Cassandra]]\" at the [[Stranded Tanker (Manhunt: Alani Kelso)|Stranded Tanker]], a group of True Sons under the command of [[Major McKenna]] would be deployed alongside Black Tusk led by [[Frank \"Firecracker\" Beckett]], in order to stop the Division Agents who were also on site. The Division would eliminate this force alongside the Major and \"Firecracker\", as well as the Hunter sent afterwards. In one final effort, True Sons were sent to the scene via Black Tusk helicopters to eliminate the Division but were also killed. Frustrated, Sokolova would radio to ask if anyone was still alive before berating General Anderson for his troops' performance.  \n\nDuring the events of ''[[First Rogue]]'', True Sons would take over multiple locations in Downtown East, prompting Aaron Keener to send the Division to drive them out as the second trial of his test. The Division would proceed to retake the True Sons occupied control points, eliminating large numbers of True Sons including five high-ranking officers.  \n\nDespite the survival of General Anderson, the True Sons are a shadow of their former strength. General Anderson's forces most likely only make up part of the surviving True Sons in DC, with most other surviving forces focused on staying alive in DC. No rank above Sergeant has been observed amongst the True Sons forces in DC except those who serve under Anderson and Sokolova.  \n\nAfter the Division followed the trail of clues left by Rogue Agent [[Alani Kelso]] to Roosevelt Island at the climax of ''[[Burden of Truth]]'', they discovered that Kelso had left them a Mobile SHD Server. However, a force of True Sons under the command of [[Colonel Bill Gadwall]] and his brother [[Lieutenant Ducky Gadwall]] had also traced the location of the server, and had been deployed by the Black Tusk to recover it. General Anderson could be heard over the radio giving orders to Colonel Gadwall, as well as Sokolova telling the General to not let her down, to which he confidently replied that she could count on his True Sons.   \n\nGadwall and the True Sons repeatedly attempted to hold back the Division, including deploying multiple helicopters and DC-62 mortar strikes. When all this failed, the Colonel personally intervened to stop the Agents, and was killed in the process. Sokolova then chimed in that she had been observing Anderson's forces, finding them to be \"mostly disposable\". Anderson then handed command to the fallen officer's brother, entrusting him to carry out the mission.   \n\nIt quickly became clear that Ducky instead chose to focus on eliminating the Agents at all costs, including deploying mortars danger close to Anderson's troops, much to the General's frustration and anger. When Anderson ordered Ducky to focus on recovering the server, stating that it wasn't the place for a personal vendetta, the Lieutenant refused and chose to fight the Agents instead, resulting in his death. With both officers killed, Sokolova stepped in and called off the operation, remarking to Anderson that the whole affair had been \"very disappointing.\"   \n\n== Relationship with other factions ==\nBeing comprised of former [[JTF]] members and possessing military-grade technology, training, and discipline, the True Sons are seen by the other factions as the most dominant faction within D.C. However, they are also known throughout D.C. by all factions as vicious, cruel, and arrogant bullies who will not think twice about threatening, making examples of, or executing dissidents in order to ensure obedience from the local populace. They rely on casual cruelty and often dispense lethal punishment for randomly chosen violations.\n\nThe True Sons and their actions on Roosevelt Island were the catalyst for the formation of the [[Outcasts]], who despise them for [[Antwon Ridgeway|Ridgeway]]'s quarantine and treatment of them, viciously torturing several True Sons that they captured and executing survivors of skirmishes. The True Sons are hostile but not actively at war with the Outcasts, and vice versa. An audio recording revealed that when the Outcasts overthrew and took over the [[Roosevelt Island]] quarantine center\u00a0the JTF (before they became True Sons) decided to monitor them rather than send more men to try and neutralize them. It's possible that the True Sons are still monitoring their movements and actions as they are tied up in a war against the Hyenas and don't see the Outcasts as a threat to their supremacy, due to their focus being on consolidating power in their territory.\n\nThe True Sons despise the [[Hyenas]], having been the catalyst for the formation of the alliance of the gangs, and has been unsuccessfully attempting to dislodge them in Federal Triangle and Judiciary Square, creating a blood-soaked no-mans-land where neither faction managed to successfully defeat the other.  True Sons generally see the Hyenas as rats and opportunistic thugs as one can be heard saying \"Hey Hyena, crawl back to your hole\" when engaging in combat against them.\n\nFollowing the death of their leader and the invasion of the [[Black Tusk]], the True Sons are now at war with every faction and are vying for control of positions within D.C. There are some incidents where some skirmish took place between True Sons and Black Tusk <ref name=\":0\">https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/gk38v7/tusk_minigunner_versus_true_sons_heavy_grenadier/</ref>. This is most likely due to their aggressive disarmament policy and the fact that they have replaced them at the top of the Washington DC food chain. This would later change under the leadership of General Anderson, who successfully allied the remaining True Sons with the Black Tusk, and the two factions can now be seen fighting alongside each other. \n==Intelligence Brief==\nThe True Sons currently sit at the top of the hostile faction \"food chain\" and are seeking to lock in their standing there. [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] field intelligence indicates that the faction's primary goals are as follows: \n*Expand territorial control to include key strategic points, access corridors, and symbolic landmarks.\n*Control critical infrastructure and local resources.\n*Dominate and incorporate any remaining population clusters in the [[Washington, D.C.]] metro area.\n*Eliminate threats and rivals including other factions and groups as well as [[Joint Task Force|law enforcement]] elements like The Division and the JTF.\n*Research the possibility of chemical or mechanical weapons, and if possible, create prototypes.\n\nOverall, the True Sons appear to be disciplined and well-coordinated. Most members are trained in either police or military tactics, though few have been deployed overseas in conflict zones. The few True Sons who aren't veterans or ex-cops are either former criminals or recruited civilians and, as a result, sometimes exhibit unconventional combat tactics. But [[Antwon Ridgeway|General Ridgeway]] has built a regiment for his troops that includes standard military training to keep them battle-ready.\n==Tactics and Weapons==\n{{Quote|1=It seems like these guys are salvaging and repurposing anything they can from this place. They're crafty bastards, I'll give them that.|2=Manny Ortega, on the True Sons Munitions Factory at the Air & Space Museum.}}The True Sons are more dangerous than the other factions in [[Washington, D.C.]] due to their superior gear, training and knowledge. They are not experienced in conflict, but they are well trained and coordinated. General Ridgeway's training system is systematic and thorough and has made sure the True Sons survived the turbulent winter and spring. As noted: \n\n* Their training is evident due to the wide variety of weapons utilized, as seen compared to the limited range used by other factions.\n*They mostly draw on candidates from the old police, military, fire, and medical services, but don't discriminate against those who are ex-criminals or recruited civilians.\n*Their troops are some of the best-equipped and trained in D.C.\n*This is both a blessing and a curse as they take longer to train and are more expensive to equip but are much more likely to succeed in battle.\n*The True Sons have access to a wide variety of military grade equipment from across the world, such as US M4 carbines and M60s, Austrian and German SMGs such as the AUG and MP5, and Russian weapons such as the SASG-12.\n*They also have access to a wide variety of ammunition types, favoring 9mm and shotgun shells, but also using 5.56 and 7.62 mm rounds, as well as explosives and rocket-propelled grenades.\n*They also have access to a wide variety of advanced secondary equipment, such as ballistic vests, helmets, supplemental armor plates, ballistic goggles, radio sets and receivers, Geiger counters, flares, and defibrillators to name a few.\n*They also have multiple research projects underway for utilization of remaining historical materials and chemicals, such as riot foam and missiles.\n*They have a number of specialists, but the most common specialist combatants are those who utilize thrown explosives, CQC, or LMGs.\n*Those specializing in anti-armor roles, chemical weapons and engineering are much rarer, but still are fairly common throughout the True Sons.\n*Snipers and Medical units are the rarest True Sons - possibly due to the long training requirement to qualify as either.\n*The True Sons are not rigidly bound to using military equipment or standard-issue weapons and ordinance.\n* Often, the more dangerous bounty targets use scavenged technology from other factions such as the Outcasts, Hyenas and Division agents, such as stolen hand or 40 mm grenades, turrets, RC cars, support stations, and S.H.D technology.\n* They have at least some kind of smuggling pipeline in and out of D.C., as there is little chance they could secure Riker MG nests otherwise.\n\n{{True Sons Weapons}}\n\n\n==Named Members==\n{{True Sons HVT|Raid=The Short Straw \nMorodova's bodyguard\nShield\nUnited Ironworks}}\n\n\n==Archetypes==\n{{True Sons Class}}\n\n\n==Quotes==\n===Combat===\n<tabber>\nAssault=\n*''Enemy spotted!'' - engaging \n*''Just lie down and die!''\n*''Fuck the Division!''\n*''Screw you, Division puke!''\n*''Fuck you, Agent!''\n*''Just give it up!''\n*''I need a fresh mag!'' - reloading \n*''This is fucked!'' - Grenade incoming\n*''I'm in the shit here!'' - Surprised at close range\n*''No!

The Campus was originally set up as a CERA refugee camp. After the harsh winter, supplies started running low and steps were taken towards long-term subsistence. Defenses were raised, agriculture programs were started, and the residents elected [[Henry Hayes]] as their leader. Henry is strong, both in body and in spirit, and leads the Campus Settlement through hard times, often believing that overcoming such requires manual labor and hard work.\n\nThis settlement is well protected by the [[Civilian Militia]], and works toward survival and self-reliance. \n\nIn its early days, the settlement was a busy but joyless place, with every waking moment devoted to basic survival tasks: procuring food and water, and maintaining shelter and security. Hayes also appointed committees to handle sanitation and medical issues. Settlement life settled into a hive-like routine of tasks. Hayes's guiding dictum was: \"He that does not work, neither shall they eat.\"\n\nThat spirit soon infused every aspect of existence. There was work, there was sleep . . . and precious little besides. Survival became the overarching imperative, and anything that detracted from labor toward that goal, even the smallest bit of levity, was unacceptable. A tone of puritanical severity began to hover over the settlement.\n== Background ==\nShortly after the initial [[Green Poison]] outbreak hit [[Washington, D.C.]] in December, [[CERA]] established a refugee center in a large open field on the campus of The George Washington University, just west of [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House.]] For more than a month, the tent camp in the University Yard focused on managing the contagion: providing patient care, housing tourists trapped in the city, and keeping the lid on simmering social unrest.\n\nAs the miserable winter dragged on, other refugee centers around the city began failing, one by one. Overrun with smallpox cases and armed thugs raiding their supplies, CERA began pulling healthcare workers out of the more dangerous camps, which quickly collapsed. By February, the University Yard camp, now called \"The Campus,\" was the only functioning refugee center remaining. \n\nRecognizing that both [[CERA]] and the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] were staggered by the scope of the pandemic and on the verge of a total withdrawal from the field, Campus denizens began to take steps toward self-reliance and long-term subsistence. First, they erected rudimentary defenses against [[Hyenas|Hyena]] raiders who attempted random forays into the camp. Next, using green spaces around campus, they began to plant and cultivate food crops. Finally, the residents elected a leader named [[Henry Hayes]] to direct the reorganization of the camp into a fortified, self-sustaining settlement.\n\nBy March, all CERA field hospitals and redistribution centers in the greater D.C. area had folded. The only truly safe sanctuaries for refugees were the three large civilian-run settlements established in the city (including the Campus) plus the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]]/[[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] Base of Operations on The White House grounds. \n\n\n== Outcasts Encroachment ==\nApril brought some relief from the cold weather but also a new threat from the west. Parties of raiders calling themselves the [[Outcasts]] began a series of hit-and-run strikes on the settlement's perimeter posts, and also harassed Campus foraging teams who regularly swept the nearby neighborhoods for supplies. A turf war was clearly brewing.\n\nBut worse than open war was the Outcasts' attempt to infiltrate the Campus with its nihilistic philosophy. Over the next few weeks, a number of prominent Campus residents became converts. Most notable was Henry Hayes's own wife, who had been made increasingly despondent by the situation and left the Campus for the Outcasts encampment.\n\nIn the wake of her departure, trust in Hayes waned and some called for him to step down. He angrily refused to do so, and his personal loss colored his hatred for the Outcasts even darker. By June, the hostile group had consolidated its control over the territory surrounding the Campus. Worse, it continued to attract converts to the Outcasts worldview. \n\n\n== Upgrades ==\nAs the agent reclaims more and more of\u00a0Washington, D.C., new upgrades and side missions will become available in the Settlements.\n{{Campus Upgrades}}\n\n== Members ==\nSeveral people working and living in the '''Campus Settlement''' are important on varying levels.

He leads the [[Campus Settlement]] and will give the player missions to complete.\n\nHenry Hayes was born into a family of laborers and has been working blue-collar jobs since he was a young man. He is a staunch Christian who reads the Bible daily. Although he sometimes feels anger and resentment towards God when bad things happen, he never questions his faith.\n\nHayes always keeps his composure under stressful and frustrating situations. He has a strong sense of responsibility and will avoid conflict unless it's absolutely necessary.\n\nHenry Hayes is the dour, hardworking elected leader of the [[Campus Settlement]]. While he excels at keeping the camp functioning and safe, he's far less effective at keeping his settlers happy and content. Hayes creates an atmosphere of stoic sacrifice in which personal leisure or fulfillment is viewed with suspicion or even hostility. The result is that the fierce, liberating nihilism of the Outcasts faction is becoming more attractive to some of his Campus residents.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]], Henry had a wife and son. His wife was a nurse and was stationed at the [[Roosevelt Island|Roosevelt Island Quarantine]]. She never returned and died there. His son met a similar fate, dying at the hands of [[Green Poison]]. After the collapse of society, Henry ended up as the leader of the [[Campus Settlement]], and was harassed by the [[Outcasts]], one of which called with a message for him of a Campus civilian captured as a hostage.\n\nFurthermore, with the trouble of growing food and being terrorized by the Outcasts, Henry made a new policy for his settlement: Everyone must do their part and work, with notable exceptions. However, he'd soon realize that the situation he's putting his people in is not sustainable. Thus, he requested for help from The Division.\n\nWith Agent [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]] and a number of agents answering the call, they helped Henry in his troubles with his settlement. Over time, the weight on Henry's shoulders became lighter as [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents eliminated Outcasts terrorizing the Campus, stopping the [[True Sons]] and their [[DC-62]] at [[Lincoln Memorial]], as well as doing their part in upgrading the settlement and helping its folks with their troubles.\n\nHenry was very thankful for the Division agents and their help as it helped the Campus in focusing to growing their food. At one time, he contacted [[Odessa Sawyer]] to send a care package to her [[Theater Settlement|Theater]] settlement as a gift.\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:NPC]]",

After True Sons members approached him and made an offer not to attack them in exchange for tax, he refused. The True Sons then launched rapid attacks against the Castle. \n\nIn the latest attempt, they used the chemical [[DC-62]] and fired them into the Castle using mortars from Jefferson Square, which leads to the downfall of the Castle. It is unknown the current status of Mike Snow, but he was most likely killed by the True Sons during the infiltration attempts or the final destruction of the Castle.\n\n{{Clear}}\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:People]]",

It was founded based on the nature of the location, which is close to the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and strong [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] presence there. It is an organized and well-protected [[Civilian Militia]] front, players can also find its leader [[Odessa Sawyer]]. As a [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division Agent]] in her past, she encourages the settlement to follow the rules, never give in to indulgence, allegedly cooperate and/or help the JTF and The Division and uphold the oath she still vows to follow even after her retirement from The Division. This settlement is located on the rooftops of several buildings, most notably [[Wikipedia:Ford's Theatre|Ford's Theater]]. As the settlement grows, it expands further onto other nearby rooftops, although most of them are inaccessible to players.\n\nThe last major survivor settlement in the [[Washington, D.C.]] metro area was established in Ford's Theater on 10th Street, just half a block from the imposing edifice of the FBI Headquarters. Home of the infamous balcony where Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, the historic theater became an unlikely sanctuary for displaced civilians seeking shelter.\n\nFord's began filling up in March, as neighborhood dwellers sought refuge from the increasingly savage [[Hyenas|Hyena]] faction attacks in the blocks north of Pennsylvania Avenue. A unique aspect of the settlement's organization is that its founder and current leader is a former Division agent, Odessa Sawyer. A field operative wounded in the Division's First Wave activation in January. Sawyer has directed the fortification work and other measures taken to protect residents from the street violence raging around the Theater. \n\n== Settlement Atmosphere ==\nThe Theater had a difficult start marked by security breaches and other setbacks, which continue to affect morale. Although the settlement is now well organized, and its leadership has helped residents develop a better sense of physical safety, [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] intel states that an angry, anxious attitude still pervades all levels of the camp. A number of settlers appear exhausted and suffering from a growing sense of hopelessness. This sensibility is no doubt exacerbated by the fact that the Theater is now almost completely surrounded by active [[Hyenas|Hyena]] territory.\n\nAlso noted in the reports are other indications of social problems: graffiti, refuse, vandalism, inter-resident theft, and incidents of substance abuse and even addiction. Although residents voluntarily selected a core governing council (headed by former agent [[Odessa Sawyer|Sawyer]]) to keep things running, the Theater group seems to lack an intrinsic sense of community. Some residents clearly feel alienated or isolated. Of course, it doesn't help those resources are scarce in the immediate vicinity, or that well-armed Hyenas are constantly howling at the door. \n\n\n== Upgrades ==\nAs the agent reclaims more and more of [[Washington, D.C.]], new upgrades and side missions will become available in the Theater Settlement. Missions marked with the Theater Settlement icon will, upon completion, either unlock a new tier or add an upgrade to the settlement.\n{{Theater Upgrades}}\n\n== Members ==\nSeveral people working and living in the '''Theater Settlement''' are important on varying levels.

She was elected after the death of the previous leader and has led the Theater Settlement through rough times.\n\n*[[Eleanor Sawyer]]\nEleanor Sawyer is the daughter of Odessa Sawyer.

It has a low rate of fire and poor accuracy compared to most other assault rifles, but makes up for it with a very high damage per shot compared to other faster-firing and more accurate rifles. The recoil of the weapons seems to pull up and right when fired in bursts, so attachments that reduce recoil should be used.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe AK-47 is an early Cold War era assault rifle of Russian origin. It proved to be so effective and reliable that it was produced in large numbers.\n\nThe AK-47 is a gas operated weapon. It cycles using a long stroke gas piston. Combined with high tolerances and a tapering cartridge this makes it very reliable. The 7.62x39mm round was designed for this weapon. The AK-47 is made out of metal with the handguard and fixed stock made out of wood. The original AK-47 has a milled receiver while the product improved AKM has a stamped receiver.\n\nThe AK-47 fires the 7.62x39mm round from a curved 30 round magazine. It is a select fire weapon that is capable of semi-automatic fire and automatic fire at 600 rounds per minute. The effective range is about 300 meters. \n\n\n== In-Game ==\nThe Classic AK-47 is used by [[Cleaners|Cleaner]] Sweepers and Cleaner Assaults, and Lower-level [[Rikers|Riker]] Enforcers. The Black Market AK-74 is used by HVT [[Last Man Battalion|LMB Agents]].\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Variants ==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" columns=\"dynamic\" widths=\"200\">\nClassic AK47.png|Classic AK-47\nMilitary AK47M.png|Military AK-47M\nBlack Market AK74.png|Black Market AK-47\nWarlord.png|{{Exotic|Warlord}}\nSurvivor AK47.png|Survivor AK-47\n</gallery>\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n*[[Cleaners|Sweepers]] use modified Classic AK-47s with improvised flamethrower attachments during close quarters engagements.\n*In-game AK-47s are modelled after the AKM, an improved version of the original AK-47 design.\n*Black Market AK-74 is also known as AK-74MR UUK, is a modernized variant of AK-74M upgraded with universal upgrade kit consisting of a new safety, dust cover and furniture featuring improved ergonomics and rails to attach accessories like aiming optics, optoelectronic sights, laser sights, weapon lights and vertical fore grips and a new muzzle device.\n*The Black Market AK-74 is grouped with other AK-47 variants, although it fires an entirely different caliber of ammunition in real-life.\n**AK-74s fire the 5.45\u00d739mm round, while the AK-47/AKM fires the 7.62\u00d739mm round.\n*The Military AK-47M is actually an AK-74M, as determined by the curvature of the magazine. It's less curved than the Classic or Black Market, signifying that it fires the 5.45mm rounds.

It is the most widely used assault rifle in bullpup configuration in the world. The abbreviation AUG stands for Armee Universel Gewehr, German for universal army rifle.\n\nAt the time of the development the AUG featured state of the art design choices. The most distinguishing feature is the bullpup configuration. The trigger is placed in front of the magazine and the receiver doubles as the stock, resulting in a very short weapon. The furniture is made of a tough polyamide. The AUG is gas operated and uses a short stroke gas piston and rotating bolt.\n\nThe AUG is known as an accurate and reliable weapon. It fires the 5.56x45mm round from 30 round translucent magazines. However, in this instance, it has been re-chambered for 9x39mm instead, using pistol cartridges instead of rifle rounds. The 42 round magazines of the light support variant can also be used. The two stage trigger allows for semi-automatic fire with a light pull and automatic fire with a full pull. The effective range depends on the barrel length and is given as 400 meter with the standard barrel.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nAn unusual SMG in the game, in that it tends to have higher innate accuracy (likely due to the longer barrel) compared to its peers, and a notably smaller magazine. Since the AUG is already among the higher DPS weapons in the game before mods despite the small magazine, it benefits greatly from extended magazines and gains significantly more DPS from this mod than many other guns, including other SMGs.\n\nBenefiting more from stability than accuracy (due to its short optimal range, a feature of all SMGs), a lucky roll or craft with the 'Stable' talent can result in a gun that has it all, accuracy, stability, high rates of fire and high bullet damage.\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Variants ==\n* AUG A3 Para XS\n* Enhanced AUG A3P\n* Tactical AUG A3P\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" columns=\"dynamic\" widths=\"200\">\nAUG A3 Para XS.png|AUG A3 Para XS\nEnhanced AUG A3P.png|Enhanced AUG A3P\nTactical AUG A3P.png|Tactical AUG A3P\n</gallery>\n\n{{Nav/Weapons}}\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Submachine Guns]]",

Chadwick spent a lot of time setting up a critical infrastructure for the [[Joint Task Force]] in the Base of Operations, including a set of backup generators that could guarantee stable JTF power and communications. At some point after the failed evacuation in [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]], Chadwick disappeared from duty and the Base of Operations suffered a catastrophic disaster when two generators exploded, killing 8 JTF staff members and injuring twenty three more. Investigations into the incident indicated that the generators had been tampered with and that there was deliberate sabotage behind it.\n\nFollowing [[Aaron Keener]]'s death at the hands of The Division, Neptune and his rogue agents were planning an attack on [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n\n==History ==\nBrandon was activated to contain civil unrest in the early days and to secure the midtown [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|quarantine zone]]. He ran into another Division agent, [[Mike]] upon activation. The two then worked as a team and formed a special bond together.\n\nBesides securing the quarantine zone, Brandon helped the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] setting up critical infrastructure at their Base of Operations, including generators.\n\nDuring the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]] retreat, Brandon and his partner Mike were surrounded with multiple [[Rioters]] and with no JTF to support them, Mike then died in the Dark Zone and Brandon escaped.\n\nDisheartened by the loss of his close comrade, Brandon held a big grudge towards the JTF for not helping him and Mike back in the Dark Zone. Brandon then sabotaged the generators that he helped built in the JTF Base of Operations, killing and injuring several JTF members. After that, Brandon disappeared.\n\nA rogue Division agent, [[Molly \"Jupiter\" Henderson|Molly Henderson]] (callsign Jupiter), found Brandon and reached out to him. She suggested a team-up, which Brandon refused. Henderson then told him to think about it more and reach out to her if he changed his mind.\n\nStill hurting, Brandon decided to do something and reached out to Henderson. Henderson asked if Brandon was fully committed, Brandon said he was, which prompted Henderson to give him a watch to take a look at. The watch was provided by rogue agent Aaron Keener and contains the latest feature: the [[Rogue Network]].\n\nNow part of Henderson's rogue agents' cell, Henderson left [[New York City]] for [[Washington, D.C.]], along with Brandon and two other rogue agents. The operation to attack Washington, D.C. was conducted by [[Aaron Keener]], whom the Brandon and the four rogue agents in his cell have strong ties with. Before leaving for Washington, D.C., Keener asked his associate, rogue Division agent [[Vivian Conley]] to give Henderson and her squad some [[Cleaners]] for backup. Henderson gave Brandon a squad of Conley's Cleaners to carry out the operation in Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter Brandon arrived in Washington, D.C., he and the Cleaners fought against the [[Outcasts]] by fighting over control points and several areas because the Outcasts are infected with the [[Green Poison]]. Agent [[Alani Kelso]] discovered Henderson's rogue agents' cell through [[Keener's Watch]]. The agent that killed Keener is now tasked to hunt down Henderson's rogue agents' cell. The agent arrived back in D.C., took out several Cleaners and Outcasts occupied locations and finally located Brandon. Brandon put up fierce resistance, but would be taken down by the agent.\n\n\n==Abilities==\nIn-game, Neptune was a [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Agent]] armed with a [[AK-47/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Black Market AK-M]], [[PP-19/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Enhanced PP-19]] , [[Drone (Skill)|Defender Drones]], [[Seeker Mine|Airburst Seeker-Mines]] and [[Incendiary Grenades]]. \n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* Despite never being seen using it in-game, Neptune can be seen holding a [[POF P416/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Custom P416 G3]] in his character artwork and an [[LVOA-C]] in the in-game briefing cutscene.\n\n== Bounty ==\n\n* [[Neptune's Cell (Bounty)|Neptune's Cell]]\n\n==Appearances==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Enemies]]\n[[Category:Bounties in The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Rogue Agents]]\n[[Category:Manhunt Targets]]\n[[Category:NPC]]",

  "N.Y.C. Dark Zone": "{{For|the Dark Zones in Tom Clancy's The Division 2|D.C. Dark Zones}}{{Quote|Over the wall, I could see bodies. Not many live people. Place feels almost deserted from the outside. But there's bodies everywhere: on the streets, hanging off the walls. Signs of struggle. Bullet holes. Blast shadows. Burned out windows and doors. Now it's\u2026 quiet. I don't mean peaceful. It's anything but that. It's a ghost town, but not empty. Just\u2026 haunted. It feels like a place that's dead and fucking angry about it.|Rick Valassi}}\n[[File:Tom-clancys-the-division-dark-zone.jpg|470px|thumb]]The '''Dark Zone''' is a large untamed region in the heart of [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]], quarantined from the rest of the already-quarantined borough. This \"no man's land\" is filled with countless bodies, some of the most ruthless and dangerous enemies in the city, and lots of abandoned hardware and gear left behind by the authorities who couldn't maintain control. Only those [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents courageous enough and well-equipped enough should consider braving the region to recover the equipment still inside, assuming they don't run into any of those who have disavowed The Division.\n\nIn ''[[Tom Clancy's\u00a0The Division]]'', the Dark Zone billed as the most dangerous region in all of Manhattan - passes as the game's \"open Player vs. Player (PvP)\" zone. Player vs. Environment (PvE) content includes dealing with some of the most dangerous NPCs in the game roaming the zone, recovering the top-grade gear and tech left behind in the zone and extracting it safely. However, the Dark Zone is also where players can go [[Rogue Status|Rogue]] and attack each other, with surviving manhunts and sabotaging item extractions providing their own rewards. The Dark Zone also serves as the location for a couple game modes, like ''[[Last Stand (mode)|Last Stand]]'' and ''[[Survival]]''.\n\n==Dark Zone Story==\n[[File:Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division Dark Zone Story Trailer - Ubisoft -NA-|250px|thumb]]When the [[The Outbreak|pandemic]] hit, the authorities gathered the sick in this area. They brought in the best scientists and the most cutting-edge medical equipment to try to contain the [[Green Poison|virus]] and look for a cure. But soon the government recognized that their measures were no longer enough. More and more people suffered from the virus and medical auxiliary equipment as well as personnel came increasingly to their limits. The cordon quickly became a fully equipped quarantine zone and the martial law came into effect. [[Joint Task Force|National Guard]] and especially for this scenario trained units tried to master that situation, but it was already too late. All of them weren\u2019t able to stand the increasing pressure and rioting, looting and chaos were now on the agenda. And that\u2019s when the power went out. Within a few hours, the military had to pull out all troops of this with contamination saturated zone and left their best equipment behind. They left behind not only the supplies, medicine, and weapons, but also thousands of infected, dying and already dead people. Few dare to go over the wall into the restricted area to pick up the remaining equipment, but fewer still come out. This is the Dark Zone.\n\n{{Clear}}\n==Gameplay==\nThe Dark Zone is the only location in which players can roam solo or in a group in an openly PvP environment without major limits, such as time limits or limited lives like in the ''[[Last Stand (mode)|Last Stand]]'' and ''[[Survival]]'' modes. In the Dark Zone, players will be able to complete special missions that offer the best loot in the game. However, loot acquired in the Dark Zone must be extracted and decontaminated before it is fully usable.\n\n===Contaminated Areas===\n[[File:Dark_Zone_Contaminated_Area.png|thumb|right|300px]]The Dark Zone has many large [[File:Contaminated icon.png|22px]] {{Exotic|contaminated}} areas that require a level 4 filter. Mostly, these are the old underground subway stations or malls. [[Cleaners]] typically roam theses areas, whereas the [[Rioters]], [[Rikers]], and [[Last Man Battalion|LMB]] roam the surface. Within these {{Exotic|contaminated}} areas, however, are Dark Zone loot crates. Most require DZ level 20 to open.\u00a0\n\n{{Clear}}\n===Landmarks===\n[[File:DZ Landmark.jpg|thumb|right|300px]][[File:Landmark icon.png|22px]] <font color=\"#714DB7\"><font color=\"#714DB7\">'''Landmarks'''</font></font> are locations throughout the entire Dark Zone that can hold noteworthy loot, along with the deadlier enemies that'll try to gun anyone down who tries to take it. On occasion, a second wave of enemies, with another {{High-end|Named}} enemy, can spawn at a <font color=\"#714DB7\">Landmark</font>, providing more dropped loot. Many <font color=\"#714DB7\">Landmarks</font> have SHD crates, as well, that contains better gear than those that lie in regular crates. SHD crates require a [[Dark Zone Key]] to open, though, and all loot acquired from these are {{Exotic|contaminated}} and must be extracted.\n\nUpon clearing a <font color=\"#714DB7\">Landmark</font>, you will receive one decontaminated item. It is sent directly to your inventory, and does not need to be extracted. This means you can equip/use this equipment immediately should it be better than one currently equipped.\n\n{{Clear}}\n===Extractions===\n[[File:Dark_Zone_Extract.png|thumb|right|300px]]Since communication to the outside is extremely limited, to start an extraction, players must go to a designated extraction zone and fire off a flare to notify [[Joint Task Force]] for pick up. Once fired, it'll take a total of 150 seconds to complete; 90 for the copter to arrive, and 60 for it to complete the extraction. Any players nearby will be alerted of the call for extraction by the loud and obvious sound the flare gives, along with HUD and [[ISAC]] notifications.\n\nOnce the extraction has started, a group of NPCs will spawn, mostly regular squads, but occasionally spawn with a Heavy-type enemy, and will attack the extraction party. Players have been known to use extraction zones for other purposes, though, such as diversions to distract rogue players so they can safely extract in another location, lure other players in to ambush them, or simple NPC farming.\n\n[[File:Rogue_ambush.png|thumb|right|300px]]When the helicopter arrives, a cable line will descend out of the belly of the chopper. It drops in approximately the area where the flare was fired, and is drawn back up 60 seconds after being dropped down. Up to 4 players can then attach their {{Exotic|contaminated}} loot to the cable for it to be taken off for decontamination. Other players are given the option to cut the cable, however, disbanding and scattering all attached loot in various locations around the extraction zone. Doing so will make the player doing said action immediately go rogue, notifying all nearby players, and almost always ends in a standoff.\n\nWhen the extraction is complete, all loot on the cable will be pulled into the chopper, taken off to be decontaminated and placed into the players stash under the \"Extracted\" tab. Players can retrieve the gear from their stash at [[Safe Houses]], the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|Base of Operations]], or [[Dark Zone Checkpoint|Dark Zone Checkpoints]]. Note that the stash for Extracted DZ loot is limited to 30.\n\n\n===Safe Rooms===\nSimilar to [[File:Safe House Logo.png|22px]] [[Safe Houses]] in the PvE Zone, so-called [[File:Safe Room Logo.png|22px]] <font color=\"#714DB7\">Safe Rooms</font> are also located inside the Dark Zone and act as a safe place for you and your team if you need to take a rest or want to escape from NPCs or hostile agents. A small box in there allows you to restock your ammunition and consumables while a DZ Vendor is always available to trade with.\n\n\n==Level 30 and Gear Score/World Bracket changes NPCs==\nWhen players reach level 30 (outside of the Dark Zone), the NPC enemies become level 30-34, depending on the players World Bracket (from 1.4 onwards). NPC levels scale with the World Bracket selection, consistent with the open world. If one player in a group is level 30, or on a different gear score bracket, that player will be separated from the group due to the [[Player Bracket|Dark Zone's Player Bracket system]]. Being a brand new Level 30 also adds a bit of suspense when going solo in the Dark Zone. Assuming that the player does not have any good weapons or gear. It should be noted that, while a players' World Bracket can be changed by the player, the player may not change his Gear Score bracket.\n\n\n== Dark Zone Supply Drops ==\n[[File:Dark-zone-supply-drop-falling-down-parachute.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]Added in with [[Patches and Updates/Update 1.1: Incursions|Update 1.1]], [[File:SD Icon.png|22px]] '''{{High-end|Supply Drops}}''' now occur periodically inside the Dark Zone. This is an event in which a V-22 Osprey drops 1-2 supply crates randomly in each section of the Dark Zone. The contents of these crates vary between [[gear]], [[Modifications|attachments]] and [[Weapons in Tom Clancy's The Division|weapons]], all of which are already decontaminated, meaning they do not need to be extracted and are immediately placed in the players' inventory. If the players inventory is already full, the items will be placed in the player's stash and can be retrieved later.\n\nWhen the event begins, aside from the HUD and [[ISAC]] notifications, the player can hear and see a V-22 Osprey fly directly over the Dark Zone. After the aircraft has left, the player can check their map for the locations of the Supply Drops. Supply Drops are marked by a yellow package icon with a parachute, and will self-destruct 5 minutes after landing. Players should take caution when attempting to take the Supply Drops, as each drop will have a squad of elite enemies being led by a named elite guarding them. The yellow supply drop icon also turns red when a player attacks the elite enemies, which can be seen by all players in the Dark Zone.\n\n[[File:Supply_Drop.png|thumb|right|300px]]To take a supply drop, it is extremely recommended, but still optional, to kill the elites guarding the drop. Then the player can simply go up to the crate and hold the action button to claim it. If the player has squadmates, all players in the squad can earn the rewards as well, but must be near the crate when it is opened to collect them. Any players that are not in the squad that has captured the crate, regardless of their distance to the crate, will not get the rewards. Which means if the agent and their squad kill all of the elites and some random person comes up and opens the crate before the agents squad does, the random person will get all of the loot, therefore stealing the agents crate. After the crate has been claimed, it will begin a self-destruct sequence and countdown to detonation. The explosion radius will be shown on the ground around it, similar to a grenade, and will deal only minor to moderate damage to players in its vicinity.\n\nIf the agent is lucky, they can actually get an {{Exotic|Exotic}} weapon or Armor piece from the named bosses they've killed who are guarding the Supply Drops or from the Supply Drops themselves.\n\n\n==Contamination Events==\n[[File:Contamination_Event.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]\nAdded in [[Patches and Updates/Update 1.6: Last Stand|Update 1.6]], {{Exotic|Contamination Events}} occur around every hour, and is located at every underground {{Exotic|contamination zone}} and lasts for 10 minutes. When the event has started the players will be notified, and the areas will be marked.\n\nThe {{Exotic|contamination zone}} will increase in contamination, going above the filter level that the player can have. During this time, the {{Exotic|contamination zone}} will reach lethal levels; anyone inside the zone will die instantly when their filter fails.\n\nAfter 3 minutes of critical contamination, the contamination level will decrease back down to Level 5. While this is still above the filter level players have, since the highest filter is level 4, it is no longer lethal. The filter will still fail, but now the player's health will drain, similar to the previous Sickness Directive in [[Underground]], instead of outright killing the player. However, this effect is more potent, so healing skills are recommended.\n\nAfter this point, two named [[Cleaners|Incinerators]] will appear in the area, along with some Elites. 4 to 6 enemies can spawn at any {{Exotic|contaminated area}}. Eliminating the threat will reward you with 3 {{High-end|Rarity|High-end}} or {{Gearset|Gear Sets|Gear Set}} items, along with loot dropped from the Incinerators.\n\n\n== DZ Leaderboards ==\nAlso added in [[Patches and Updates/Update 1.6: Last Stand|Update 1.6]], the Dark Zone now has thematic and monthly leaderboards. There are 4 activities that count for points on the leaderboards, and these shift weekly for the thematic leaderboard, and monthly for the monthly leaderboards. However, these leaderboards are not accurate 24/7. The boards update once a day, at Midnight GMT (the daily reset for missions and HVTs). Being close to the top of each board puts a player in a reward tier. These reward tiers reward players with more items the higher they are on the board.\n\n\n==Dark Zone Mission==\n* [[Discover the Dark Zone]]\n\n\n==Dark Zone Areas==\n* [[DZ01]]\n* [[DZ02]]\n* [[DZ03]]\n* [[DZ04]]\n* [[DZ05]]\n* [[DZ06]]\n\n\n==Dark Zone North Areas==\nThese areas were added into ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]'' in [[Patches and Updates/Update 1.6: Last Stand|Update 1.6]], and are playable in the base game. In [[Survival]], however, these areas remain locked currently. Note that almost every enemy in DZ North is an Elite or Named enemy. The exception to this are <font color=\"#714DB7\">Landmarks</font>, which may spawn multiple waves of enemies, or calling Extractions. In these cases, there may be Veteran enemies.\n* [[DZ07]]\n* [[DZ08]]\n* [[DZ09]]\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nDark Zone.png|Division agents heading towards the Dark Zone\nDark Zone SHD Team.png|A group of Division agents exploring the Dark Zone\nDark Zone SHD .png|Three Division agents aiming their weapons in the Dark Zone\nDZ .png|Three Division agents in the Dark Zone\nDark Zone Gunpoint.png|Three agents holding up another agent at gunpoint\nDark Zone Extract.png|An agent beginning a cargo extraction\nRogue Agent.png|A Rogue agent approaching a downed agent\nRogue extract.png|A Rogue agent seeing an extraction flare\nRogue ambush.png|A Rogue agent sighting up on an agent\nExtraction Hijack.jpg|A Division agent attempting to hijack an extraction\nDark Zone Extraction.jpg|A team of agents defending their position at an extraction zone\nHijack.png|A Division agent cutting the extraction rope, hijacking the operation\nSupply Drop.png|A Division agent spotting a SHD Supply Crate landing\nSupply Drop fight.png| SHD Supply Drop Zones will bring out fighting between players and NPCs\n1490570324_The Division Wallpaper (1).jpg|The rogue level icon\nFlat,800x800,075,f.u1.jpg|The rogue icon\n</gallery>\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Aside from a few locations or situations, there is no music playing in the background when the player is in the Dark Zone.\n** However, music does play when:\n*** When the player first enters the Dark Zone.\n*** The player is in a {{Exotic|contaminated area}}.\n*** When the player is making an extraction or in an extraction area when an extraction is going on.\n*** When the player is at Manhunt status.\n* In [[DZ06]], on the side of the [[Safe Houses|Safe Room]], there's a mural in honor of Stefania, an Italian girl who was a big fan of ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]'' who passed away.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n[[ru:\u0422\u0451\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0417\u043e\u043d\u044b (\u041d\u044c\u044e-\u0419\u043e\u0440\u043a)]]\n[[Category:Dark Zones]]\n[[Category:Dark Zone]]\n[[Category:The Division]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Division]]",

  "Rogue Status": "{{Wpn-nav|the division=1|the division 2=1}}[[File:Rogue watches.png|thumb|300px]]'''Rogue Status''' is a status reserved for Division agents who have disavowed the rules of [[Strategic Homeland Division]]. These agents must be hunted down, and either killed or apprehended according to the degree of their crimes.\n\n== In the Lore ==\n[[File:Rogue group.png|thumb|299x299px|A group of rogue agents.]]In the lore, Rogue Status is given to any agent who breaks protocol. When this status is given to an agent, their wristwatch will change from orange to red, and they will have their connection to the [[ISAC|ISAC Network]] severed.

This mechanic affects players who act maliciously towards another player, causing them to become targets of regular agents as well as having rewards being attached to taking them down.\n\n\n=== Mechanic Rules and Functions ===\nRogue Status starts at {{Exotic|Rank 0}}, as described below. Each time a ''NON-Rogue'' player is downed or killed by the player OR another player in the group, the rank increases by 1, to the max of {{Exotic|Rank 5}} - {{Manhunt}}\u00a0{{High-end|Manhunt status}}. \n\nWhile Rogue, the players location will occasionally pulse on every players minimap, unless the Rogue player is running the [[Pulse#Mod: Scrambler|Scrambler]] mod on their [[Pulse]] skill. When {{High-end|Manhunt}} status is achieved, however, the location of the player is always shown to every player in a certain radius, and nothing can hide the players location.\n\nAlso of note, while Rogue, players are unable to access Dark Zone [[Safe Houses]] or Dark Zone [[Dark Zone Checkpoint|Checkpoints]], leaving the player unable to resupply unless they lose their Rogue status or are killed and respawn. A remedy to this situation is for Rogue players to run the [[Banshee]] {{Gearset|Gear Set}}, as the 4 piece bonus allows the player to resupply their ammo every 30 seconds while Rogue.\n\nIt should be noted that killing other Rogue players do NOT increase the rank of the player. Only killing non-Rogue players increase the rank.\n\nTimers of Rogue players stop when receiving damage from non-Rogue players. This includes {{High-end|Manhunts}}, however, the timer of {{High-end|Manhunts}} do not reset to 5 minutes when killing other players. \n\nAll skills that deal damage will prioritize non-Rogue agents over NPC enemies. For instance, a player has a [[Turret]] active which is attacking a [[Cleaners|Cleaner]] NPC and there is a non-Rogue agent standing in range of the Turret. The moment said player goes Rogue, the Turret will immediately stop attacking the Cleaner and will open fire on the non-rogue agent. (This will also reset the Rogue agent's timer and prevent it from counting down since the game counts this as the rogue agent being in combat despite the fact he may not be in the vicinity. Defensive skills such as Support Station, First Aid and Smart Cover will not provide their effects to non-rogue agents. (The Area of Effect of the First Aid and Support Station skill will also turn red for non-rogue agents.) \n\n\n=== Rogue Status Ranks ===\n[[File:Untitled-5.png|30px]]\u00a0{{Exotic|Rank 0:}} Activate rogue protocol (Default PC: Shift+Z), or begin to hijack an extraction. The agent will get a 20-second timer. Timer will be reset if the agent attacks non Rogue players.<br/>\n[[File:Untitled-4.png|30px]] {{Exotic|Rank 1:}} The agent will get a 90-second timer. Timer will be reset if the agent attacks non Rogue players.<br/>\n[[File:Untitled-3.png|30px]] {{Exotic|Rank 2:}} The agent will get a 120-second timer. Timer will be reset if the agent attacks non Rogue players.<br/>\n[[File:Untitled-2.png|30px]] {{Exotic|Rank 3:}}\u00a0The agent will get a 160-second timer. Timer will be reset if the agent attacks non Rogue players.<br/>\n[[File:Untitled-1.png|30px]] {{Exotic|Rank 4:}} The agent will get a 240-second timer. Timer will be reset if the agent attacks non Rogue players.<br/>\n[[File:Manhunt.png|30px]]\u00a0{{Exotic|Rank 5:}}\u00a0The agent will get a 300-second timer. Timer will not reset if the agent attacks non Rogue players.\n\n\n=== <u>Rewards and Penalties</u> ===\nThe more players a player downs/kills the higher the player bounty will be and the more items and XP the player will lose if killed. The player will lose more Dark Zone keys, Dark Zone Credits and Dark Zone XP and have a higher chance to drop all the players contaminated loot if the player is killed as Rogue.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n[[Category:Gameplay]]\n[[Category:Content]]\n[[Category:Dark Zone]]",
  "Rogue Status/Tom Clancy's The Division 2": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Rogue Status}}{{Wpn-nav|the division=1|the division 2=1}}[[File:Rogue Status TD2.png|thumb|right|300px]]'''Rogue Status''' is a mechanic in the [[D.C. Dark Zones|Dark Zone]]. This mechanic affects players who act maliciously towards another player, causing them to become targets of regular agents as well as having rewards being attached to taking them down.\n\n== Mechanics ==\nA player can activate the Rogue status by holding down the map button or \"Rogue Toggle\" while in the Dark Zone. It takes about 300ms to register and then you are Rogue. It does not impact what you are doing. So, for example, you can aim at someone, press the Rogue Toggle while aiming, and open fire. It can also be toggled while moving.\n\nA player can activate the Rogue status by holding down the map button or \"Rogue Toggle\" while in the Dark Zone. It takes about 300ms to register and then you are Rogue. It does not impact what you are doing. So, for example, you can aim at someone, press the Rogue Toggle while aiming, and open fire. It can also be toggled while moving.\n\nThat being said, other players still get a notification that someone is going Rogue so that they have at least a chance to react.\n\nThe Rogue Toggle was originally introduced back in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]'' when it became clear, that going Rogue on damage to other players can be exploited. That is why the Rogue Toggle was introduced that had to be pushed for multiple seconds while the other players around you got a notification that someone was about to go Rogue.\n\n=== Clearing the Players' Status ===\nOnce a player has gone Rogue, there are a variety of ways to clear their status. The primary way is to wait out the timer that appears for {{Exotic|Rogue}} players. However, this option is not available for Manhunt Status players. For {{High-end|Manhunt}} Status players to clean their status, they must find an SHD Terminal and clear themselves. Alternatively, when the reach an SHD Terminal, they can choose to increase their status and the bounty on their head. The other way to clear the players' status is to reach the [[Thieves Den]]. Once inside, all levels of Rogue will reset.\n\n== Rogue Status Ranks ==\n[[File:Rogue Rank 2.png|20px]] {{Exotic|Rogue}}\n*This stage is toggled manually or by cutting an extraction rope. Killing players raises the Agent's Rogue level, and killing enough players raises the {{Exotic|Rogue Status}} to {{High-end|Manhunt}}. SHD Agents can eliminate Rogue Agents to claim their bounties. As with the first game, the Rogue Status will broadcast your position on the map and it has a timer on it, that you can wait out and claim your reward.\n{{Manhunt}} {{High-end|Manhunt}}\n*This is the final stage in the Rogue loop where the timer is gone and in which players have to clear their {{High-end|Manhunt}} status at one of three SHD Terminal that will be activated somewhere in the [[D.C. Dark Zones|Dark Zone]] to earn their rewards. You also have the option to Increase Notoriety at any terminal (by deactivating it), effectively raising your rewards but also requiring you to cash-out at one of the remaining terminals. General terminal areas are visible on the mega-map for SHD Agents while a {{High-end|Manhunt}} is active, but precise terminal locations are only revealed to the {{High-end|Manhunt}} player. This creates a cat-and-mouse style gameplay loop where SHD Agents can track down {{High-end|Manhunt}} Agents and attempt to claim their bounty.\n**Surviving Manhunt rewards are not contaminated.\n\n=== Prior to Title Update 8 ===\nOriginally ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]'' had a three-tier Rogue progression system that decided based on your action what level of Rogue you were. It included a \"grey\" version of Rogue triggered by non-lethal actions such as stealing, while the current \"red\" version was called \"Disavowed Rogue\" and was triggered by lethal and hostile actions towards other players.\n\n\n== In The Lore ==\nWhile there are agents like [[Aaron Keener]] and [[Theo Parnell]] who went [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue]] because they turned their back on their mission, recent events had forced the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] and its allies to see that being Rogue doesn't necessarily mean being evil.\n\nIn the events of ''[[Hidden Alliance]]'', the insurance policy files that [[Faye Lau]] left in her laptop prior to her death showed that she was trying to help the Division and was trying to warn them about the threat. Moreover, it was revealed during the events of ''[[Vanguard|Vanguard\u2063]]\u2063'', her [[Black Tusk]] infiltration mission was part of a secret alliance with Keener to take down the [[DIAMOND|Diamond Network]].\n\nAnd while Division agents aren't marked as Rogue as per [[ISAC]], they are considered Rogue by Black Tusk and the [[Hunters]]. Indeed, when the agents confronted [[Brian Johnson|The Recruiter]] at [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: The Recruiter)|Camp White Oak]], he claims that they went Rogue the minute they allied with Agent [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]]. In simpler terms, any Division agent who doesn't fall in line with Black Tusk and the Hunters are considered Rogues in their eyes.\n\nAdditionally, Keener and his Rogues helped smuggling civilians out from the chaos of [[Lower Manhattan]] to [[Brooklyn]], where they'd help in building a [[The Bridge|settlement]]. And as of recently, Keener and his team have allied with the Division to work together against Black Tusk/Hunters, as the threat that [[Natalya Sokolova]] and [[Calvin McManus]] pose could destroy everything they hold dear.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''",
  "Safe Houses/Tom Clancy's The Division 2": "{{Wpn-nav|the division=1|the division 2=1}}\n\n'''Safe Houses '''are a small sanctuary for civilians, and [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents alike to rest and recharge away from the dangers of [[Washington, D.C.]], providing a social hub to interact with other players, a waypoint for the fast travel system, a place to refill on ammo and supplies, and a respawn point should an agent fall in the field. There is a Safe House hidden in practically every district in [[Washington, D.C.]], but an individual can locate one by looking for the white circle painted on a nearby wall, occasionally with an arrow within pointing in its direction.\n\nNormal Safe Houses are locations that were once hideouts by Division agents that have since gone M.I.A. or K.I.A. Each Safe House contains a pinned [[Bounties/Tom Clancy's The Division 2|Bounty]] map, a matchmaking laptop, an SHD Stash, and a locker where agents can sell gear they do not want. Most safe houses have multiple exits, and each one has a radio that plays a certain radio station.  \n\nDark Zone safe houses are located in the center of each Dark Zone; each Dark Zone has one safe house. These safe houses were used as Security Centers for their respected Dark Zones before they were evacuated and closed off. These safe houses restock the agent's armor kits and ammo, and have a locker that gives the agent one piece of gear every 24 hours. \n\nThe [[Dark Zone Checkpoint|checkpoints on the Dark Zone's perimeter]] count as safe houses to an extent, as they all act as safe zones and provide fast travel locations, a respawn and resupply point, a SHD stash, and a locker to sell gear. \n\nNote that if a player is carrying contaminated items in a Dark Zone checkpoint and attempts to fast travel, the game will warn that those items will be destroyed (the same as if they attempted to walk back into the Light Zone with contaminated items on their person). Additionally, players cannot see other players not in their group inside a checkpoint; if a player not in the group enters a checkpoint from inside the Dark Zone, they will disappear from sight.\n{| class=\"article-table\"\n|+\u00a0\n|-\n!District\n!Level\n!Safe House\n!Location\n!Vendor\n!JTF Officer\n|-\n|[[Downtown East]]\n|2-7\n|Final Epiphany\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Division 2]]",
  "The Outbreak": "=November 27=\nBanknotes coated with Variola Chimera - a highly contagious smallpox strain now called \"[[Green Poison|The Green Poison]]\" - circulate in [[New York City]] on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving and the biggest shopping day of the year. Packed crowds moving in frenetic, wide-ranging patterns spread the infection quickly. With a seven-day incubation period, the deadly virus remains undetected as shoppers, tourists, and other travelers carry it away from Ground Zero.\n\n\n=December 1-5=\nDisease symptoms begin to emerge, and within days a first wave of the contagion rages across the city's populace. The initial surge of cases quickly swamps local medical facilities. As a result, the federal government's Disease Control Division (DCD) and other federal authorities step in quickly and declare a state of emergency.\n\nBut the spread is so fast that containment is impossible. The [[wikipedia:District of Columbia National Guard|National Guard]] is summoned, and [[New York City]] is locked down. Troops and local authorities block roads, suspend public transport, and prohibit crosstown travel. The populace is ordered to shelter in place and stay in their homes. All businesses close. The next day, New Yorkers awaken to an eerily silent city.\n\n\n=December 6-10=\nU.S. President [[Lawrence Waller]] orders U.S. military forces to surround and seal off [[New York City]], including all waterways via naval blockade.\n\nThe [[CERA|Catastrophic Emergency Response Agency]] (CERA) begins mass vaccinations using existing stockpiles. The initial focus is on first responders in the primary contagion vectors. But soon health workers are inoculating the public at large at clinics, workplaces, parking lots... wherever [[CERA]] can reach people.\n\nIn this strange calm, city life seems to shift back toward normal. Stores reopen for limited periods, with people allowed back on the streets between strictly enforced curfew hours. [[CERA]] establishes field clinics throughout the city, distributing supplies, antiviral medications, and personal protective equipment.\n\n[[CERA]] also sets up a mass treatment facility for advanced smallpox cases inside a central section of Midtown Manhattan - a sealed-off \"sick zone\" inside the quarantined borough. A number of Manhattan's most iconic landmarks inhabit this neighborhood: Carnegie Hall, the Empire State Building, the Plaza Hotel, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and Trump Tower. Medical personnel begin to round up and bus infected citizens into this sector. Construction of a reinforced perimeter wall begins.\n\nWithin days, two sad truths become clear. First, the existing smallpox vaccine does not work against the new strain of the virus. And second, the relaxation of movement restrictions has allowed the disease to spread faster and farther. Thousands of new cases spring up - and the first horrifying wave of deaths sweeps across the city.\n\n\n=December 11-14=\nThe [[Wikipedia:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] officially declares the outbreak a pandemic. The president invokes martial law nationwide.\n\nIn [[New York City|New York]], food and supplies begin to run low. Black markets and smugglers begin to flourish. The first signs of civil unrest appear: looters break curfews and threaten hospitals and stores. Fear and anarchy start to spread like a new contagion. Panicked New Yorkers, trying to escape the city, clash with troops enforcing the quarantine lines. Streets grow increasingly lawless.\n\nHeavily outnumbered and rattled by mob violence. security teams begin to withdraw from certain chaotic neighborhoods. Surviving police and military units consolidate to form the [[Joint Task Force]].\n\nThe [[JTF]] locks down all five boroughs and restricts travel between them. Although this makes citywide safety management easier, it also puts immense pressure on teams operating in the densest and hardest hit borough: Manhattan.\n\nThe pandemic reaches [[Washington, D.C.]] and spreads quickly. Lurid media coverage of [[New York City]] chaos spurs D.C. residents to react with panic, and civil unrest spreads almost overnight. Public services break down within seventy-two hours.\n\n\n=December 15-17=\nFederal authorities designate new containment zones in Manhattan to control crowd migration across the island. Military engineers begin erecting makeshift perimeter barriers called Dividing Lines at 14th Street and 58th Street. These split the borough into three distinct sections: Lower, Midtown, and Upper.\n\nThe sealed-off central Midtown \"sick zone\", where [[CERA]] has been busing and detaining smallpox victims, is becoming increasingly dangerous. Raging mobs, violent escape attempts, and other lawless activities are getting worse. As [[JTF]] wits suffer heavier losses, they begin to leave entire blocks unpatrolled.\n\nIn [[Washington, D.C.]], the U.S. Capitol Police and Metro Police lock down the entire District of Columbia. [[wikipedia:District of Columbia National Guard|National Guard]] units are summoned to provide extra protection for federal workers and government officials.\n\n<div style=\"margin: 0px left; text-align: left; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #FF9900; padding: 10px;\">\n<center>'''<u>Note on D.C.

The Commanding General notifies the under secretary of the army of the request and its nature. The under secretary consults with the attorney General and the secretary of defense on the request. The attorney General establishes policies to be observed by military forces in the event they are used for military support to civil authorities in the District. If approved by the under secretary of the army, the Commanding General advises the mayor of the decision and commits resources as necessary to assist within the parameters established by the under secretary and the attorney General. If advance coordination is possible, HSEMA will coordinate with the DCNG military support officer.</div>\n\n\n=December 18-20=\nPresident [[Lawrence Waller|Waller]] invokes National Security Presidential [[Directive 51]] to ensure continuity of the federal government in the face of growing crisis. Boarding Marine One, POTUS is evacuated from [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]] to [[Wikipedia:Camp David|Camp David]] in Maryland along with his family, cabinet and senior staff.\n\nThe president immediately activates the first wave of [[Strategic Homeland Division]] agents embedded in [[New York City]].\n\nTwo days later, a rolling blackout strikes the sealed-off Midtown \"sick zone.\" The sector-now a death trap filled with piles of infected corpses, fires burning unchecked, and predatory gangs-soon acquires a new name: [[Dark Zones|The Dark Zone]]. At night, the streets turn into a grim \"no man's land\" of disease, death, and feral savagery.\n\nWithin twenty-four hours, the [[JTF]] and all medical personnel are forced to abandon the Dark Zone's mass treatment facilities and beat a hasty retreat south. They pull back to the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|James Farley Post Office]] in Midtown Manhattan, a massive building that occupies two full city blocks and serves as a critical base of operations for both [[CERA]] and the [[JTF]].\n\n\n=Late December=\nThe first wave of [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents deploys into the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]] to set up an outpost, seeking to quell the violence and restore order. Their disturbing reports suggest an almost unimaginable level of chaos, more primitive than anywhere else in the city. \n\nOver the next several days, [[JTF]] base dispatchers gradually lose contact with the entire Division team. None return. Meanwhile, [[Rioters]] threaten to overrun the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|James Farley Post Office]]. \n\nAs the New Year approaches, [[New York City]] is in the vise grip of an unprecedented humanitarian disaster. Preliminary counts suggest more than two hundred thousand citizens have succumbed to the contagion and violence. Many more have been displaced and linger in shelters or clinics. All basic civic services have shut down. \n\nA mass breakout from [[Wikipedia:Rikers Island|Rikers Island]], the [[Wikipedia:New York City Department of Correction|New York City Department of Correction]]'s four hundred-acre jail complex on the East River, releases thousands of violent, desperate criminals into the diseased cityscape. Many convicts band together to form a powerful gang called the \"[[Rikers]]\". Like urban warlords, they start taking brutal control of neighborhoods.\n\n\n=January 1-5=\nThe president activates [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents in the District of Columbia, where food and gas shortages combined with widespread power outages have triggered large-scale rioting and looting. High level government officials begin to relocate to secure sites around the country. \n\nFollowing the precedent set in [[New York City]] all military and the law enforcement agencies in [[Washington, D.C.]] are combined under a single command called the [[Joint Task Force]]. The National Park Service helps [[CERA]] establish a quarantine zone for D.C.-area infected patients on [[Roosevelt Island|Theodore Roosevelt Island]], the 88.5-acre national memorial site on the Potomac River. \n\nCERA also establishes a sizeable refugee camp inside the [[Castle Settlement|Smithsonian Castle]] on the National Mall. Known as The Castle, the camp is created as a safe haven for out-of-towners stranded in southern D.C. after the early evacuations. \n\n\n=January 6=\nPOTUS activates a second wave of [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents in [[New York City]]. Despite suffering key losses during the airlift into Manhattan's harbor district, the new team moves swiftly to dispel [[Rioters]] and lift the siege of the [[N.Y.C. Base of Operations|James Farley Post Office]]. Once the Manhattan operational hub is secured, the [[JTF]] (with heavy Division support) begins to expand its presence across the stricken borough, block by block.\n\n\n=January 7=\n[[President Waller]] dies from cardiac arrest. Rumors spread that he succumbed to the virus, triggering a new shockwave of panic. Vice [[President Mendez|President Thomas Eliezer Mendez]] is sworn in as POTUS. He refuses to leave D.C. for a remote location. \n\n\n=January 10=\nThe [[Joint Task Force]] promotes the head of the Maryland National Guard, [[Antwon Ridgeway|Colonel Antwon Ridgeway]], to JTF Field Commander, Southeast Region, with the new rank of General. Ridgeway begins a merciless crackdown on mob violence in the capital. \n\n\n=Late January=\nCivilian communications in [[Washington, D.C.]] go mostly offline as the city's infrastructure crisis continues. \n\nSizeable [[Wikipedia:District of Columbia National Guard|National Guard]] camps and field distribution centers help maintain order in the southern part of the district. But continuing gas shortages trigger riots north of [[Wikipedia:Pennsylvania Avenue|Pennsylvania Avenue]], and fierce gang fighting spreads across the northern neighborhoods. \n\n\n=Early February=\nAs the situation in [[Washington, D.C.]] worsens, the U.S. military is thrown into crisis. Many units are crippled after suffering from a broken chain of command, a rash of desertions, and widespread deaths\u2014both to smallpox and the attrition from multiple uprisings in metropolitan areas. \n\nInternational trade shuts down, knocking local economies across the globe into a tailspin. This exacerbates the food and security crises that are arising as a result of the contagion as it inevitably spreads from region to region.\n\n\n=February 14=\nIn D.C., several major criminal gangs fighting viciously for control of the region north of [[Wikipedia:Pennsylvania Avenue|Pennsylvania Avenue]] call a truce and form a [[Hyena Council|council]]. This meeting unites the murderous factions into a loose confederation called the [[Hyenas]] who employ insurgent-style tactics. \n\n\n=Late February=\n[[Antwon Ridgeway|General Ridgeway]]'s overzealous and increasingly lethal measures in support of the forced quarantine leads to reprimands and eventually arrest, a court martial, and incarceration. But loyal members of his [[JTF]] unit break him out. Under Ridgeway's leadership, the renegade force forms a highly trained and well-equipped militia known as the [[True Sons]]. Their aim: to establish territory and dominate the populace. \n\nMilitary and paramilitary operatives are suddenly recalled from their deployments worldwide, and are quietly installed into quarantined areas within the U.S. \n\n\n=Early March=\nSpring eases some emergency situations that were worsened by winter weather, and communities nationwide begin adapting to the new reality. But in [[Washington, D.C.]], the collapse and withdrawal of the [[JTF]] cedes much of the city to gang control.\n\nBitter survivors of a forced quarantine on [[Roosevelt Island|Theodore Roosevelt Island]] in the Potomac River overthrow the camp to form a vengeful faction calling themselves the [[Outcasts]]. Led by the charismatic [[Emeline Shaw]], the faction sets up its stronghold in the [[Potomac Event Center]] and starts pushing eastward from the Potomac. \n\nA [[CERA]] refugee center in the University Vard at [[Wikipedia:George Washington University|The George Washington University]] just west of [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]] begins to achieve self-reliance and self-defense. [[Civilian Militia|Residents]] build the area into a settlement community known as The [[Campus Settlement|Campus]]. \n\nIn the east, [[Antwon Ridgeway|General Ridgeway]]'s True Sons militia seizes control of the [[Capitol Building|U.S. Capitol Building]] and establishes its headquarters there: a powerful symbolic victory. \n\n\n=Late March=\nDesperate civilians seeking refuge from savage street fighting in north-east [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] continue to gather in historic [[Theater Settlement|Ford's Theater]]. Led by former [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agent [[Odessa Sawyer]] after the death of the settlement's previous leader, the residents fortify the structure and build a self-sufficient settlement referred to simply as \"The Theater\". \n\n\n=April 9=\nJust three months after being sworn in, [[President Mendez]] dies from an apparent suicide, however the circumstances surrounding his death indicate that the Secret Service may be compromised. Holed up in NORAD HQ with other members of Congress, Speaker of the House [[Andrew Ellis]] is sworn in as the new POTUS. \n\n\n=Early May=\nAnti-air missiles strike Air Force One as it returns President Ellis from NORAD to [[Washington, D.C.]] The plane crash-lands near the [[Capitol Building|Capitol]]. Ellis survives, but is captured and held hostage by the [[Hyenas]]. \n\nThe [[SHD Tech|SHD Network]] mysteriously goes down. [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] operatives, cut off from each other, enact their operational guidelines which lead them back to the nation's capital. Over the following days and weeks, agents arrive from various points across the United States to find the agency's [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]] Base of Operations besieged by hostile factions. \n\n\n=Late May=\nThe three surviving [[Washington, D.C.]] settlements - The [[Castle Settlement|Castle]], The [[Campus Settlement|Campus]], and The [[Theater Settlement|Theater]] - come under increasing pressure from local aggressors - the [[True Sons]], the [[Outcasts]] and the [[Hyenas]]. With The [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]]'s main base reeling from devastating attacks as well, agency teams are forced to spread their limited resources ever thinner as they defend the settlements, hoping to expand the city's network of safe areas and resource trading. \n\n\n=Early June=\nThe [[True Sons]] launch a chemical attack on the settlement at the old [[Castle Settlement|Smithsonian Castle]]. The Castle's defenses fall almost immediately. Most residents are either killed in the fighting or executed upon surrender, but a handful are extracted to safety. \n\n\n=Late June=\n[[Black Tusk]] - the organization revealed to be responsible for the [[SHD Tech|SHD Network]] sabotage - advances on D.C. [[Andrew Ellis|President Ellis]] is extracted from the [[Bank Headquarters|World Bank]] by [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents and holds a speech at [[D.C. Base of Operations|The White House]]. \n\n\n=July=\nAfter a mission to the [[Capitol Building|Capitol]], [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents recover a briefcase that is required to access the location of a potential broad-spectrum antiviral. [[Andrew Ellis|Ellis]] disappears without a trace as [[Black Tusk]] invade D.C. and put the city under siege.

While nearly all of them are being lowered, some deployable skills like the Hive can now be picked up and re-located on the fly while the Turret has a more robust deployment system. With these changes, the 50% cooldown reduction on skill-self-destruct became redundant, leaning towards overpowered and so that particular feature was removed in order to improve the overall flow of using these skills from battle to battle\n** Skills now automatically scale with the Skill Tier attribute\n** Skill Mods now have no requirement to equip\n\n== Loot ==\n* Reduced overall loot drop quantity\n* Item power, quality, and quantity now scale more strongly with difficulty\n\nDeveloper comment: This change is intended to make loot feel more meaningful.

  "Operation Dark Winter": "{{Quote|Dark Winter has revealed how vulnerable we've become. Our lifestyle, our security, our safety depends on a delicate and unstable economy. We've created a system so complicated that we no longer understand how to control it. Oil, power, shipping, transport -- we live in a complex world, and the more complex it gets, the more fragile it becomes. The system is built on a global supply chain that gets things where they're needed -- just in time. We've created a house of cards. Remove just one, and everything falls apart. And what's fueling this system? Money.}}In 2001, an operation known as \"Dark Winter\" was launched. It was a real-world exercise that tested the emergency response to a bio-terror attack on the United States. The simulation spiraled out of control within a few days, and predicted that a \"breakdown in essential institutions,\" civil disorder, and massive civilian casualties.\n\nThe simulation\u2019s target was to assess the shortcomings during such a national emergency, should it come to a biological attack against the American people. This project served for creating preventive measures and strategies to cope with this kind of problem. Moreover, this should make the government as well the population aware of such a problem.\n\nThe scenario of Dark Winter was about a local smallpox attack on Oklahoma City. It was designed so that things were out of control soon. It resulted in an emergency to the fact that the National Security Council, on the one hand, had to focus on locating the attack-origin and on the other had to contend with the problem of the ever-spreading virus. Not being able to keep in step with the virus with such a rapid contagion rate would mean for the high rate of civilian casualties, that all emergency equipment in America would reach their limits, a breakdown in essential institutions and civil disorder.\n\nDark Winter has revealed how vulnerable we have become.\n\nThese catastrophic contingencies and the fact that many people would lose their lives have been used to demonstrate the weaknesses of the U.S. health infrastructure, but secretly to point out that it would not be able to avert such a threat and deal with. Not to be forgotten is also the resulting stampede among the population, which would lead to a complete stop of the social apparatus, which in turn would entice people to outbreaks of violence at all ends. Also, intelligence services such as TV and radio would have enormous problems to provide appropriate security procedures for the population.\n\nMany years later and with a retrospective to Dark Winter, a new presidential directive called [[Directive 51]] was put into effect tacitly.\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n\n[[de:Operation: Dark Winter]]\n[[Category:The Division Wiki]]",

A [[New York City]] native, his personal pirate radio show is called [[''Wouldn't You Know It''|<nowiki>''Wouldn't You Know it''</nowiki>]] where he talks about the current issues with [[Manhattan Region|Manhattan]], what he has found out about various topics, and his myriad rumors and theories.\n\nHis radio show can be heard very frequently over the radios at safe houses and in [[The Terminal]].\n\n== Biography ==\nRichard Valassi (\"Richie\" to the neighborhood; \"Riccardo\" to his grandmother, Gisella; \"Valasshole\" to his Army buddies) was the youngest of three born to Frank and Bette Valassi, who ran a cheese shop in Little Italy. Rick was bright and attended Bronx Science, but the draft interfered with his parents' plans for him to go to college.\n\nWhen he returned from the war in 1971 (shrapnel destroyed his knee on his first day back in country on his second tour), he was inspired by John Kerry's testimony to the Fulbright Commission and spent a couple of years working with Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), planning rallies, marches, and other civil disobedience.\n\nEventually the need to make a living intervened, and Valassi took a job with the U.S. Postal Service and enrolled in night classes at Kings College (back when it was in the Empire State Building) on the G.I. Bill. He's worked for the USPS ever since.\n\nThe [[Green Poison]] crisis feels like the moment his whole life has been building toward: a chance to use the network of bureaucratic drudges he's amassed over decades to gather information about what's going on and how those with money and power are planning to exploit it. Rick always imagined himself as a voice in the night, speaking truth to power, arming regular people with information. Now he's doing exactly that. \n\n{{Clear}}\n== ''Wouldn't You Know It'' ==\nRick's radio reports include many topics, generally providing a semi-informed civilian's perspective on the events of the game. Topics include the nature of the [[Green Poison]], observations and warnings about the various [[factions]] across Manhattan, the [[N.Y.C. Dark Zone|Dark Zone]], [[Directive 51]] and [[Strategic Homeland Division|The Division]]. \n\nAn admitted conspiracy theorist with a paranoid streak, most of his reporting is based on either first-hand observations or information from his \"sources.\" He tends to be cynical about the current state of affairs but remains genuinely concerned for the city and his fellow New Yorkers, continually urging his listeners to stay safe, keep the faith, and keep him abreast of any new information that arises.\n\nRick admits to having stayed in Rikers Island for a short time during his youth.\n\n\n== Judy Walters ==\nThe \"[[Missing Person: Judy Walters]]\" mission series features Valassi attempting to reach out to [[Judy Walters]], a would-be whistleblower for the pharmaceutical company [[Vexix]], to get her information on how her company may have withheld information on their progress towards a cure for the [[Green Poison]]. The final [[ECHO]] in the sequence - Judy accidentally struck dead in the street by a taxicab - features Rick himself standing in the street, on the phone with a news editor and explaining how he saw the accident himself. \n\nWith Judy's death, he momentarily lamented the loss of his story before finding her USB stick in the street, which [[ISAC]] identifies as containing \"non-disclosed\" information regarding Vexix. Rick proclaims that \"this story isn't over\" before walking off.\n\n\n== Role in Warlords of New York ==\nFollowing the end of the Warlords campaign, Rick Valassi is heard on the radio during a cutscene. He states that, without the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]], the local [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] and [[Peacekeepers]] would have been less successful (or killed). He goes on to thank the agents for, in his words, \"De-worming the Big Apple.\"\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]'' ([[Warlords of New York]] Expansion)\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:NPC]]\n[[Category:The Division]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]",

This gave [[Coyote]], a high-ranking Hyena member, an idea to form a Council within the Hyenas, ensuring cooperation between the different clans, and making sure that they all have power and leadership centralized within the faction.\n\nAfter slight disagreements, other Hyena bosses agreed to the idea. The Council was then formed and was led by Books, the Assembly Supervisor.\n\n[[File:UBITD002_Main_2000x.jpg|thumb|left|300px]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Dissolution of the Council ==\nAs several [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents arrived to [[Washington, D.C.]] to take back the capitol and restore the [[SHD Network]], the Hyena Council faced numerous losses, which started with [[Coyote]] buried six feet under in [[Jefferson Trade Center]] by the agents after they restored the local [[ISAC]] node and to avenge their fallen comrade, [[Agent Espinoza|Espinoza]].\n\nAnd when the Division assaulted the [[Bank Headquarters]] to locate and rescue President [[President Ellis|Andrew Ellis]], they eliminated the bodyguard [[Rebound]] and Councilmember [[Roach]]. This made the remainder of the Hyena Council desperate and decided to make a stand at [[District Union Arena]]. Mayhem tried to convince them otherwise, but they didn't listen. Despite the numerous numbers, [[Books]], [[Diesel]], and [[Dime]] went off the board when the Division assaulted the Arena, putting the Hyenas in disarray.\n\nHowever, [[Mayhem]] and [[Zodiac]] weren't at District Union Area, thus they are still alive and remain at large.

Because we can't beat the True Sons in a straight up fight. We don't have the training, or the discipline. So we have to be smarter than them, and fucking each other over at every opportunity isn't smart!|[[Books]] to [[Mayhem]], on the need for the Hyenas to organize against the True Sons}}The Hyenas are a loosely organized gang of hedonistic scavengers who rely on violence and intimidation to prey on struggling civilian encampments. These opportunistic raiders have no greater agenda other than to exploit weakness and vulnerability of those who were torn by the outbreak of the [[Green Poison]], and thrive by capitalizing on the misfortune of citizens that were affected by the outbreak. \n\nAs civilized society collapsed in the greater metropolitan area of [[Washington, D.C.]], citizens who gravitated to acts of depredation - stealing, plundering, raiding, pillaging, ambushing, double-dealing, etc. - to survive began to band together into clans to further gain supplies for their plundering. Some named themselves and claimed turf, similar to how youth gangs operate. But most were amorphous groupings whose membership and leadership shifted from day to day.\n\nAs the brutal, anarchic winter turned into spring, six larger clans rose to prominence in the shattered streets north of Constitution Avenue. For weeks, their vicious turf battles destabilized entire neighborhoods and terrorized the surviving citizenry. But in February, these six clans called an interpack truce that led to the creation of a so-called \"freedom council\" with each clan represented (many lesser clans exist but are not represented). This council has declared a series of purposes that they've termed \"freedoms\": \n*The freedom to conduct \"business\" (plunder) within the clan's sphere of influence without interference or consequence from other clans.\n*The freedom to accumulate resources of value/wealth for the clan's own consumption as well as for bartering opportunities with other clans.\n*The freedom to prevent enemies (i.e., any organization not designated a party to the council agreement) from acquiring control of any turf within the northern district.\n\nThe council also made one final declaration. The leaders created an umbrella designation for all six clans, calling themselves the Hyenas and officially making them unified into one technical clan. \n\nDespite a lack of centralized organization, the Hyenas are shrewd and well-inured to the use of violence. They care nothing for civilians other than as possible resources of survival goods, sometimes even terrorizing, killing, and hunting merely for sport or their amusement. They are callous opportunists, not only preying on a disrupted city but also actively resisting and undermining stabilization efforts by local and federal authorities in order to keep themselves in control of the settlements without any federal government interference. \n\n== Formation of the Council ==\n{{Quote|We've got a lot of dead wood on this council... I'm saying they won't go down easy... Sometimes you've got to exercise restraint, assess the situation. If we do this, there'll be repercussions, and we need to prepare for which way shit's gonna fall out.|[[Dime]] to [[Mayhem]], on assessing the council's deadweights and how to handle them.}}The Hyenas were formed as a loosely organized gang of hedonists and marauders in the wake of [[Green Poison]] pandemic. Many of them were either criminals prior to the crisis or just civilians who gave in to their depraved desires from the chaos going around Washington D.C. As they enjoyed their hedonism and preying on struggling civillians, they also found themselves having difficult time against the more organized [[True Sons]]. To handle this threat, the Hyenas formed a council to unite and face their problems together. Of course, maintaining power as a member of the council requires ruthlessness. When one member dies, another takes their place.\n\nHowever, not everyone in the council agreed in how to approach long-term goals for their faction. In one comm intercepted by Division agents, it involved two council members [[Mayhem]] and [[Books]] arguing whether to focus on fighting the True Sons or continue indulging in their chaos and debauchery\n\nThe Hyenas were secretely supplied by [[Black Tusk]], giving the faction more advanced weaponry to face off against their enemies: True Sons, Division, and otherwise. As far as the Hyenas are concerned, their supplier were secret admirers who see them as \"the baddest motherfuckers in D.C\". In Black Tusk's eyes, however, the Hyenas were just a means to wage a proxy war to allow them more space to take over the city.\n\nAs luck would have it for the Hyenas, [[Air Force One]] got crashed right outside the Capitol Hill with [[President Ellis|President Andrew Ellis]] as the only survivor. Ellis was given to the Hyenas by the Black Tusk in secret, with the Hyenas hoping to use the POTUS as leverage.\n\nBut for the Hyenas, their days of senseless violence, chaos, and debauchery would soon come to an end.\n\n== Fall of the Hyenas ==\n{{Quote|Listen up! We've got devils on our house and they mean to kill us all. Stand and fight, you hear me? Stand and fight!|\n[[Dime]] in a desperate attempt to rally the remainder of Hyena forces during the Division's assault on District Union Arena}}As Division agents flocked to Washington, D.C to help in restoring the SHD Network, they also did their part in taking back the city block by block from hostile forces, including the Hyenas. At Grand Washington Hotel, agents were sent to rescue [[Eleanor Sawyer]], Odessa's daughter, from the Hyenas. Many of those Hyenas would fall, including Saint, a dangerous Hyena and council candidate.\n\nAt [[Jefferson Trade Center]], Hyenas managed to capture [[Agent Espinoza]] while he was trying to reactivate the ISAC node underneath the building. Agents were sent to reactivate the node and rescue Espinoza. However, Espinoza was being tortured by Coyote, one of the Hyena council members. Despite their attempt to rescue him, [[Coyote]] shot Espinoza and sent him to his death. Agents promptly eliminated Coyote to avenge their fallen comrade, causing a blow to the Hyena council.\n\nAs time goes on, more and more of Hyenas operations would get disrupted and their territories captured by the Division and their allies. At [[Bank Headquarters|the Bank Headquarters]], many Hyenas were killed by Division agents who went there to recover the black box from Air Force One, including [[Roach|Roach']]<nowiki/>s bodyguard, [[Rebound]]. But the agents soon learned that President Ellis is held hostage by the Hyenas, promptly rescuing him and extracting him from Bank HQ. This was a blow for the Hyenas as Mayhem was concerned their supplies would go dry as soon the rest of the council learns they lost the POTUS. Despite Roach's viciousness, he was killed by the agents, dealing another blow for the council.\n\nBut their biggest blow would happen at [[District Union Arena]]. Realizing that the Division would come knocking sooner or later, the Hyenas and the rest of their council decided to make their stand there despite Mayhem's objections. Therefore, Mayhem and Zodiac were not there when the Division assaulted their stronghold. During the assault, [[Books]], [[Diesel]], and [[Dime]] were all killed alongside many Hyena forces, effectively ending the Hyena council.\n\nWith the council down, the Hyenas went into disarray, finding themselves at war with every faction in the city and vying for control. During the Black Tusk's invasion, they also took over the [[District Union Arena (Invaded)|District Union Arena]], prompting the Division to assault the stronghold and stop the PMC. However, they'd learn that most of the supplies the Hyenas had in their stronghold belonged to Black Tusk and that the PMC were supplying the Hyenas the whole time. Nonetheless, the agents pushed Black Tusk forces off the stronghold.\n\n== Disarray ==\nIn the wake of this disarray, a number of Hyenas have tried to take leadership to no avail. Meanwhile, reports of Hyena activities across the city came about, prompting the Division to investigate. At [[Nelson Theatre Hostages|Nelson Theatre]], Hyenas took civilians there as hostages, which didn't succeed as agents went there to eliminate Hyena forces there as well as [[Zero]], who was the lead Hyena in the kidnapping. In the [[Central Aquarium]], they also took a small community who were using the Aquarium to care for the sea animals as hostages. But just like before, the Hyenas in the Aquarium met their defeat by Division agents, rescuing the community in the process, And in the [[Nightclub Infiltration|Tens Nightclub]], the Hyenas were conducting supply lines for their Spice drug overseen by [[The Chemist]], while [[Emily Lee|Agent Emily Lee]] went there to disrupt it. The Hyenas there managed to kill Lee, though they met their demise by Division agents sent there, with their Spice supply lines disrupted.\n\nWhen the Rogue Network got activated, many Hyenas flocked to Rogue Agents, who had hoped to use this alliance to take revenge against the Division. This was unwise as such agents like [[Lucy \"Venus\" Anders|Venus]], [[Sueko \"Wraith\" Tanagi|Wraith]], and [[Felix \"Kestrel\" Sokolov|Kestrel]] were killed by Division agents, leaving the Hyenas scattered.\n\nUnfortunately for the faction and their troubles, the Black Tusk stopped supplying them during the events of ''[[Price of Power]]'' in order to restore their alliance with True Sons. Without the infrastructure and resources the Hyenas were provided from Black Tusk, they'd fall into complete disarray.\n\nDuring the events of ''[[First Rogue]],'' the Hyenas took over multiple locations in Judiciary Square, prompting Aaron Keener to send Division agents to push them out as the first trial of his test. The agents proceeded in taking over Hyenas-controlled control points, eliminating a large number of Hyenas and a dozen high-value individuals.\n\nWith Mayhem and Zodiac still unaccounted for, however, its only a matter of time if the Hyenas would either dissolve or be revitalized and take their revenge against the Division and their enemies.\n\n== Hyenas rebuilt ==\nThough [[Black Tusk]] had cut their ties with the Hyenas as part of re-establishing their alliance with the [[True Sons]], recent events had them change their mind as they became involved in rebuilding the Hyenas, which included supplies, a new Hyena archetype that use RPG, and rebuilding the [[Hyena Council|Council]]. As part of his candidacy to the Council, [[Bichon]] and his Hyenas were given orders from their supplies and contact, Marty \"Sparrow\" Kincaid to assault the [[Space Administration HQ: Theo Parnell|Space Administration HQ]] and capture [[Theo Parnell]].\n\nHowever, Division agents located Theo in the building and fought their way against the Hyenas, eventually extracting Parnell via a helicopter. With this failure, Bichon was desperate to prove himself by scavenging tech left behind in the building. Aware that a rebuilt Hyena council with Black Tusk's support is bad news, Division agents went to the lower floors to defeat Bichon and the rest of his Hyenas in the RnD lab. As they confronted Bichon, he was wearing specialized Black Tusk tank armor with self-repair system that made him immune from conventional firearms. With direction by ANNA, the agents overloaded the satellite module, which caused an EMP wave that permanently disabled Bichon's self-repair system in his armor. \n\nAfter much attrition, the agents managed to defeat Bichon, and in his final moments, he cursed at them for denying him his victory. \n\nDespite this victory, the reality that Black Tusk is supplying Hyenas once again shows that they are going all in to stop the Division, and eliminate them by any means necessary, even when it means rebuilding the Hyena Council.\n\nWhether [[Mayhem]] or [[Zodiac]] are involved in this venture remains unknown\n\n== Leadership ==\n{{Quote|We form a council. You have a problem, you leave your piece at the door, and we deal with it together. As an organisation.|Coyote, on the Hyena Council's formation.}}The Hyenas leadership and government structure is a combination of a federation and an autocracy. As a federation, the Hyenas are led by a [[Hyena Council|Council]] of Hyena clans. Each clan is self-governing and relatively independent of one another but are all unified as one. As an autocracy, each clan is led by a single leader who has absolute authority over his/her own clan and represents them within the council, acting as the speaker that voices the choices of his/her clan represented in the Council.\n\nOriginally the Hyenas were divided and often fought each other for control of turf to spread each clan's influence until a clan leader named [[Coyote]] proposed to other clan leaders to unify together. She argued that they all faced a common foe, the [[True Sons]], and that they need to band together if they were going to survive. After much debate, the other clan leaders agreed with Coyote and thus the [[Hyena Council]] was formed.\n\n\n== Intelligence Brief ==\n{{Quote|The neighborhoods you'll be moving through are Hyena territory. They're a bunch of vicious assholes that prey on the weak and vulnerable, and kill for kicks. They also destroy whatever they can't take for themselves.|[[Manny Ortega]], on Hyena Territory and their method of operation}}Much like their animal counterparts, the Hyenas are generally opportunistic raiders and scavengers who prey on the weak but can also stand their ground against more powerful foes. The Hyenas appear to consist mostly of late teens and young adults who are either criminals, affiliated with gangs before the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]], and normal citizens who wish to cash in the anarchy and lack of law enforcement caused by the Green Poison. In fact, they've been known to manufacture drugs as drug labs can be seen within Hyena occupied buildings. As noted from their weapons and tactics:\n\n* They mostly consist of young adults and late teens who exhibit reckless combat tactics and rely on unyielding aggression and suppressive fire.\n* They are more lax about cover than disciplined opponents such as True Sons, often shoot without aiming, or simply take drugs and charge.\n* Their weapons mostly consist of stolen police or civilian weaponry, consisting of mostly pistols, submachine guns, and shotguns, loaded mostly with 9mm or .45 ACP rounds, but 5.56 and 7.62 mm rounds are used by higher ranking Hyenas for Assault Rifles and LMGs.\n*Their secondary equipment seems to mostly consist of stolen police and SWAT equipment, smoke grenades, tear gas munitions, gas masks, and ballistic goggles, but also has stolen FBI equipment and C4 explosives.\n* They are equipped and trained sufficiently in explosives and electronics to create weapons such as explosive RC cars and sniper turrets.\n* Their council is also shown to have a sufficient level of government structure, and mark their territory with green paint and fumes.\n* They are also open to use their enemies' equipment as well, using stolen True Sons assault turrets, Outcast Flamethrowers, and even stolen Division technology, such as Drones, Turrets, Fireflies, and Seeker Mines to name a few.\n{{Hyena Weapons}}\n\n\n== Relationship with other factions ==\nThe Hyenas are hostile towards anyone who attempts to jostle in on their territory, regardless of faction. They hate the [[True Sons]] in particular as they were the original reason for the unification and appear to be on the defensive against them, seen on the southern edge of Hyena territory and the Northern edge of True Sons territory (Federal Triangle). The Hyenas also appear to be hostile towards the Outcasts, most likely due to their want of control of D.C.  The \"clans\" of Coyote, Saint, Diesel and Dime all possess control points with miniguns, suggesting that their clans were doing the bulk of the fighting against the True Sons.\n\nThey are hostile towards the [[Outcasts]] as an [[ECHO]] located on H Street NW, near [[The World's End|the World\u2019s End]] control point provides evidence that at least one group of Hyenas and at least one group of Outcasts were fighting over territory while trying to take out a squad of True Sons guarding a building in [[Downtown West]]. This suggests that the Hyenas see the Outcasts as a threat to their survival in Western D.C., and are trying to keep them at bay till they can muster the numbers needed to crush their control of West D.C.\n\nFollowing the death of several [[Hyena Council]] members and the invasion of the [[Black Tusk]], the Hyenas are now at war with every faction and are vying for control of positions within [[Washington, D.C.]] They have also attempted to re-organize under new leaders but failed as The Division has killed any Hyena that has attempted to.\n\nOften after the fall of the Hyena Council, Rogue Agents would often attempt to recruit the Hyenas for their own purposes, namely [[Lucy \u201cVenus\u201d Anders|Venus]], [[Sueko \"Wraith\" Tanagi|Wraith]], and [[Felix \"Kestrel\" Sokolov|Kestrel]]. Often this would prove to be a poor decision as The Division eliminated these Rogue Agents, often killing any Hyena who sided with them.\n\n\n==\u00a0Named Members ==\n{{Hyena HVT}}\n\n\n== Archetypes ==\n{{Hyena Class}}\n\n\n==Quotes==\n===Combat===\n<tabber>Assault=\n*''You know what happens when you fuck with a Hyena?''\n*''How do you like me now?

He's a [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] SIGINT who became a coordinator for [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents in [[Washington, D.C.]], filling a role similar to [[Faye Lau]] in ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''.\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was a National Guard signal-intelligence and communications specialist. He lost an uncle to a Proto-[[Hyenas|Hyena]] gang while the two of them were together, and this fueled Manny's desire for justice. He rapidly became part of the hardcore contingent of the [[Joint Task Force]] stationed at the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]], and became the voice in the earpiece of surviving [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents. He assigns the missions for the agent to complete and is in charge of coordinating SHD operations throughout [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nMixing a shrewd of situational awareness with acerbic humor, Manny quickly wove himself into the fabric of The Division in D.C. He still has some family in California, but he is not able to contact them at present due to [[SHD Network]] issues.\n\n\n== History ==\n=== Tom Clancy's The Division 2 ===\nManny Ortega was in [[Washington, D.C.]] when the [[The Outbreak|outbreak]] hit. During the first days, before the total collapse of society, Manny's uncle (Mateo Ortega) was killed by two future members of the [[Hyenas]]. After this point, Manny spent his time as a signalyst in the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]]. He slowly rose in rank mainly through attrition. His superiors, for one reason or another, left their positions, and he took their place. It is mainly due to JTF command evacuating the city due to the chaos as well as the large number of defectors who formed the [[True Sons]]. He became the Division Coordinator after their [[SHD Network]] went down. \n\nWhen [[Alani Kelso|Agent Kelso]] told Manny about the [[Broad Spectrum Anti-Virals|broad-spectrum antivirals]], he found it hard to believe. However, he was convinced, knowing the stakes.\n\nManny and the JTF had difficulty maintaining the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]] due to skeleton crew. With the chaos engulfing D.C., it didn't take long for Hyenas to the attack the base. Thankfully, [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents went in and helped them. And with them on the city, they could start the road to not only restore the SHD Network, but take back the city from hostile belligerents.\n\nOver the course, Manny coordinated Division agents to work their way to decimating the [[Hyenas]], [[Outcasts]], and [[True Sons]] as well as taking steps in restoring the SHD Network. As the SHD Network was restored and President [[President Ellis|Andrew Ellis]] was rescued, the Division set their sights against the strongholds of their enemies. The Hyneas and the Outcasts went into disarray after their strongholds fell, culminating with the True Sons defeat in [[Capitol Hill]] and the recovery of President Ellis' briefcase, marking a victory for the Division and their allies.\n\nHowever, this victory was short-lived with the Division facing a new and dangerous enemy.\n=== Black Tusk invasion/Classified assignments ===\nIn the midst of [[Black Tusk]]'s invasion of [[Washington, D.C.]] and President [[President Ellis|Ellis]]'s disappearance, Manny coordinated with [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents to push the hostiles off the city, including territories and strongholds previously held by other enemy factions. After the discovery of a facility under the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]] which held the anti-virals and later stolen by Black Tusk thanks to Ellis, Manny coordinated with the agents towards [[Tidal Basin]] to recover the anti-virals while dealing with the hostiles. When [[Milla \"Wyvern\" Radek|Wyvern]] attempted to blow up the White House with missile launchers, Manny made an evacuation attempt to prevent mass casualties. Thankfully, the agents disabled the launchers and eliminated Wyvern, allowing the White House staff to live for another day.\n\nManny also coordinated a team of eight Division agents to the [[Washington National Airport]] to push off Black Tusk who were holding [[DDP-52 Razorback|experimental technology]] there. Despite the advantage those hostiles had, the agents managed to defeat Black Tusk right here and there.\n\nObviously, this wasn't the end for Black Tusk as they were still fighting in the city. Meanwhile, Manny helped agents in [[Classified Assignments]] in various locations of D.C. A few notable ones being [[NSA Site B13]], [[Mexican Embassy Crash Site|Mexican Embassy]], and [[Central Aquarium]]. In NSA Site B13, Manny learned that NSA were keeping watch on [[Gordon Amherst]]. In the Mexican Embassy, agents rescued Pilot [[John Yazzie]] from Outcasts when his helicopter got shot down. And lastly, agents rescued the Aquarium community from Hyenas, one of them being [[Mari Singh]], Manny's future girlfriend.\n=== Camp White Oak/Kenly College ===\nWhen the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] became aware of President [[President Ellis|Ellis]]'s location at [[Camp White Oak]], Manny coordinated with Division agents to find and capture President Ellis while a couple [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] squads distracts Black Tusk. Evidently, Black Tusk anticipated the threat, eliminated all JTF squads and evacuating the Presidents via Marine One helicopter. Despite this setback, agents managed to put down [[Black Tusk|B.T.S.U.]] Operator [[Ellis Galveston]].\n\nWhen a distress call came from missing [[Task Force Proteus|JTF Squad Proteus]], Division agents were sent to [[Kenly College]] while Manny helps coordinate across the three areas to find the squad. In the process, they disrupted the [[Outcasts]]' plans, recovered the [[Mobile SHD Server]], and rescued [[Jack Arnold]].\n=== Recruitment event at Manning National Zoo ===\nWhen [[Black Tusk]] took over [[Manning National Zoo]], Manny coordinated the agents there, to eliminate any threat the hostiles are posing. However, it'd turn out there was a recruitment event going on due to the losses Black Tusk sustained. Thus, agents eliminated the hostiles as well as leaders of Alpha, Bravo, Gamma, and Delta.\n\nManny remarked that Black Tusk are getting desperate in replenishing fresh troops, making them more dangerous.\n=== An invaded Camp ===\nAfter the events of [[Camp White Oak]], a dozen of [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] forensics teams were sent to recover any data left behind. [[Black Tusk]] became aware of this, so they sent forces including [[Bardon Schaeffer]]'s candidates for his unit to prevent their enemy from extracting any information. Agents were sent to stop them, including the elimination of Schaeffer's candidates.\n\nManny was satisfied, knowing that Schaeffer was frustrated at how it went down in the camp.\n=== Post-Coney Island ===\nManny became aware of the actions [[Cindy McAllister]] did by hacking the [[Black Tusk]] mortars to assist the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] during the events at Coney Island. He got worried that McAllister was too wrapped up in the digital world, thus he relieved her of duty and ordered her to spend around time with people, even sending McAllister to Doctor Mitchell Billings to help with her problems, psychologically. \n=== Warlords of New York ===\nManny was not involved in the events for ''[[Warlords of New York]]'' campaign, but he was aware of [[Faye Lau]]'s defection to [[Black Tusk]] and her assassination of President [[President Ellis|Ellis]] in the climax for ''[[End of Watch]]'', which made him upset at her and disavowing her for her actions.\n== A resurgent True Sons and an alliance with defectors ==\nIn the aftermath of [[Faye Lau]]'s death, a resurgent [[True Sons]] force made their way to [[Washington, D.C.]] led by Captain [[Captain Lewis|Fred Lewis]]. Lewis used to work together with Manny, until he defected to True Sons. When Manny learned the truth about Faye Lau and [[Bardon Schaeffer]], he was reluctant at first as he saw Schaeffer as the enemy and not an ally. Though [[Alani Kelso|Agent Kelso]] convinced him that they need Schaeffer as he's the key to stopping [[Black Tusk]].\n\nAfter the events at [[Jefferson Trade Center (Manhunt: Captain Lewis)|Jefferson Trade Center]] and considerable losses, the True Sons leader General [[General Anderson|Peter Anderson]] decided to rebuild an alliance with the Black Tusk.\n\nNot wanting anything to do with Black Tusk, Captain Lewis reached out to Manny to help in stopping this. Manny refused at first, given Lewis' culpability in True Sons' atrocities. But over time, Manny put his feelings aside and helped Lewis in this venture alongside the assistance from [[Candice Wallace|Candice \"Wally\" Wallace]]. At one point, Lewis got captured by Black Tusk and was sent to [[Pentco Fairview Power Plant (Manhunt: General Anderson)|Pentco Fairview Power Plant]], prompting Manny to send [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents to rescue him.\n\nDespite losing the opportunity to take down General Anderson, agents managed to rescue Lewis and getting him to extraction. Although that meant the True Sons and Black Tusk are now allies, Manny was grateful that his friend was in one piece.\n== Reconstructing the Castle/A Deceptive Scheme ==\nAfter decontamination efforts cleaned up the [[DC-62]] chemicals that devastated the [[Castle Settlement|Castle]] few months prior, Manny decided to recruit civilians to help in reconstruction efforts for the settlement. This included [[Mari Singh]], [[Lauren Fong]], [[Eva Garcia]], [[John Yazzie]], [[Jack Arnold|Jack]] and [[Mel Arnold]], [[Mitchell Billings]], [[Cindy McAllister]]. At some point, Manny and Mari got close, conceiving a child, although Manny wouldn't be aware of that until Mari told him. At one point, Manny was in a session with Doctor Billings, venting about his obsessive need to try control everything and worrying what his child would think of him.\n\nManny also allowed [[Vikram Malik]] into the Castle to help with the power grid. Despite the latter backstabbing him and the [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]], Manny let Vik in as he had valuable intel on [[Natalya Sokolova]] and [[Calvin McManus]] and it would turn out that Vik only betrayed the Division because he was forced to delete any dealings Nat had with ODEA Tech.\n\nThere was still work to be done against [[Black Tusk]]. Natalya Sokolova had personally hired EoD specialist [[Zachary \"Stovepipe\" Beattie]] and gave him a team to secure and deploy explosive ordnance. Considering the rumors of dirty bombs that [[Outcasts]] which devastated Saint Louis, eliminating Stovepipe was a top priority.\n\nHowever, it would turn out that Stovepipe was a distraction as Natalya had him killed due to disobedience after he learned further about the dirty bombs, which were recorded in encrypted [[Hunters|Hunter]] drones that were intercepted by Division agents. Furthermore, Nat used that distraction to have Black Tusk attack the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]] and cripple the Division's Network using the countermeasure. \n\nDespite the Division's counterattack thanks to the [[Mobile SHD Server]], Black Tusk managed to take the [[Perfusion Bioreactor]]. And despite not being able to eliminate [[Bardon Schaeffer]] as his unconscious body was in the panic room, [[Captain Lewis|Lewis]] was killed by a Hunter when he held off a squad of Black Tusk. The revelation that Black Tusk managed to cripple the [[SHD Network]] worried Manny, as he was concerned they'd be screwed if their enemy uses their countermeasure again.\n\nAnd to add further insult, Black Tusk kidnapped the civilians from the Castle, with Natalya leaving a Hunter Drone recording meant for Manny. There, she taunts him and makes it clear that D.C., the United States, and the entire world belongs to Black Tusk. Nat also revealed that Mari is under Black Tusk's custody and demands to Manny to hand over the White House if he wants to see her again.\n== Rescuing civilians ==\nIn the aftermath of this, Manny and Wally assessed the number of people kidnapped by [[Black Tusk]], which included [[Vitaly Tchernenko]] and [[Harlan Lloyd]]. Manny mourned for the loss of [[Captain Lewis|Fred Lewis]] by giving his friend's dogtags to Ransom (Fred's dog), as a way to remember him. Not wasting time, Manny coordinated with [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents to rescue their people\n\nOver the course of these rescues, Manny was puzzled over the humane treatment that Black Tusk was doing to their captured civilians, making him wonder what exactly is [[Natalya Sokolova]] planning. But it soon turns out that those humane treatments are just a scheme to make Black Tusk look benevolent and for the people.\n\nAfter [[Mari Singh|Mari]] was rescued, Manny reunited with her and was happy to learn that their child is gonna be a girl. While Manny suggested to give the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]] to Black Tusk as he was still trying to wrap his mind over the events, he changed his mind when Mari tells him that working with them will not end well and it is for the best interest for the future of his people and his child to stop Black Tusk.\n== The hunter becomes hunted ==\nAfter [[Mari Singh|Mari]]'s rescue, the [[Mobile SHD Server]] has been acting oddly, having spotty range and glitched connection. At the same time, [[Brian Johnson]] made his appearance after his absence, which was around the same time The Recruiter was out in the open and securing the kidnapped civilians. Manny coordinated with [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents to rescue more of their people in addition to making their move against The Recruiter.\n\nOne by one, the civilians were rescued, and after [[Vikram Malik]] was rescued from his captivity (again...), he requested the Division to go to [[Camp White Oak (Manhunt: The Recruiter)|Camp White Oak]] to rescue his sister, [[Birdie Malik|Birdie]]. During the assault, the agents were having trouble with their [[SHD Tech]] and Johnson not saying anything. After Birdie was secured, it'd turn out that Johnson is the Recruiter and had the mobile SHD server with him. Agents found themselves in a tough fight with the [[Hunters|Hunter]] as conventional weaponry were no use against him. Thanks to Birdie deploying the countermeasure, agents managed to put a dent to Johnson, but that wasn't enough, so Birdie used the mortars against him and ending him. With [[Calvin McManus|Cal]]'s most esteemed Hunter gone, the Mobile SHD Server was secure and Birdie was sent to the [[Castle Settlement|Castle]].\n\nThe revelation that Hunters are embedded in the Division was unnerving to the settlements, arousing suspicions and doubts, even asking questions if [[Alani Kelso|Agent Kelso]] can be trusted. Manny didn't entertain the notion when Vikram asked him about Kelso. Around the same time, [[Natalya Sokolova]] began broadcasting propaganda to sway people to [[Black Tusk]]. And to make matters worse, Manny was informed by [[Roy Benitez]] that Agent Kelso went missing.\n\nManny debriefed with Birdie, wondering about Natalya's intentions the Mobile SHD Server. It turns out that Nat wanted it to modify Black Tusk's tech. When Manny asked her if its possible, Birdie told him its possible with the right code and right coder, but maintained it that she didn't give Nat the code as that's not her area of her expertise and something like that requires an expert coder like Wally, Claire, or Maira.\n\nLater, Manny debriefed with Birdie about Black Tusk's HQ, as she was sent there many times to fix structural issues with one of Natalya's inner circles in Black Tusk. She also explained that the HQ's security systems are accessed via a biometric, requiring a hand, retinal, biorhythm, and voice confirmation at the same time. This lead Manny to think that the person is the key, making Birdie call him the \"most dad non-dad person she met\", which was not a compliment.\n== Search for Kelso ==\nAs [[Strategic Homeland Division|Division]] agents go to [[Lower Manhattan]] to search for [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]], they learn a few shocking things. \"Cassandra\" was the codename for [[Faye Lau]] and it would turn out that she was secretly working with the [[Rogue Division Agents|Rogue Agent]] - [[Aaron Keener]], to undermine the [[Black Tusk]] and the [[Hunters]] with \"the key\" inside a specialized SHD Crate.\n\nWhen Kelso's location got pinged in the [[Stranded Tanker (Manhunt: Alani Kelso)|Stranded Tanker]], Agents fought through [[Black Tusk]]/[[True Sons]] forces, including a Hunter. Manny was shocked when he hears that Black Tusk is looking for Cassandra as he believed Faye Lau was alive. Though in reality, it was actually Kelso as she had Faye Lau's watch with her. After the agents got a shock therapy from the SHD Crate, Keener cloned [[ANNA]] to his watch and opened the crate, revealing a [[Mobile SHD Server]]. Kelso joined alongside him and [[Theo Parnell]], marking her Rogue, and left [[New York City|New York]].\n\nThis upset Manny heavily, leading him to vent his frustrations with Mari. However, Manny managed to calm down when Mari helped rationlize things when she told him that Kelso is trying to finish Faye Lau's mission against [[DIAMOND]].\n\nAt some point, Manny talked with Birdie as he was confused how the Division and Black Tusk communication systems are the same. Birdie explained that they work in the same root network and that Natalya was working to fix that exploit that needed more server power. Birdie admitted in her help with this, as she was deceived by Brian Johnson that it would get rid of the Rogues plaguing the Division and wasn't aware that Manny and Division agents in D.C. are the rogues the whole time. Manny protested the notion, but Birdie retorted that he and the agents are fighting Black Tusk and Calvin McManus is working with them. And the way Birdie sees it, if Cal is still in charge, they're still the rogues.\n\nLater, Manny discussed with Birdie about Black Tusk's biometric security systems as he was still confused how they work. He thought the systems only needs an eye and a hand for access, though Birdie remarked it'd be too easy as someone could take a BT's hand and a eye. \n\nShe explained that Claire Ortiz went extra steps for the security systems by adding biorhythm and voice recognition, as it can be unique for each Black Tusk individual in addition to requiring all four keys being used at the same time to get past deepfake tech. However, the security systems aren't foolproof as the wrong key or wrong biorhythm signature can lock a user out. Best-case scenario, someone else resets the security systems and the user is sent for interrogation. Worst-case scenario, it activates the killswitch that kill a user and anyone around them.\n\nManny was confused about these measures, feeling they're a bit extreme. Birdie explains those measures are only for high-security locations and in some territories that Black Tusk control like a cargo ship, they use the gas or shock treatment to any user who entered their credentials the wrong way.\n== Trials of Aaron Keener ==\nWhile Manny wasn't involved in the first couple trials that [[Strategic Homeland Division|Agents]] go through, he was aware of what [[Aaron Keener|Keener]]'s doing. During the ''[[First Rogue|Nyx]]'' trial, he called out the [[Rogue Division Agents|rogue agent]] as he believed the trials could get the agents killed. However, [[ANNA]] revokes comms access to both as she needed the agents to complete the final trial without interruption. Manny was surprised as he didn't see [[ISAC]] do something like that, but Keener retorts that ANNA is more advanced and intelligent than ISAC and he proposed a ceasefire.\n\nDuring their discussion, Manny made it clear to Keener that he doesn't trust him, though he still wants to trust [[Alani Kelso|Kelso]]. Manny wanted to know what Keener showed to Kelso that made her join him, though Keener requested to discuss in person. Manny agreed to let Keener in the [[D.C. Base of Operations|White House]] with a few conditions: No weapons or tech, only his watch and comms. Be put in a cell for interrogation. Stay in the cell until he brings Agent Kelso and can vet him. Keener accepted the deal without hesitation.\n\nAfter Keener arrived to the White House and was incarcerated in the panic room, he shared his first bit of intel to Manny, discussing about the Cabal; A shadow organization of powerful people and [[Natalya Sokolova]] is a member of that organization. [[Calvin McManus]] has aspirations to become one, but lacks wealth and legacy, making him a lackey for the group. Manny found the information a little far-fetched, even calling it \"so 80's\".\n\n== Securing the Rogues ==\nManny Ortega was involved with the Agents mission in securing the other two members of Keener's team who went alongside him to D.C; Theo Parnell and Alani Kelso, as they were in hiding. He also gave express orders for the agents not to kill them, as they're still important. And given his friend, he believed that Kelso was due to make some explanations for her recent actions.\n\n=== Glasses ===\nAfter solving Parnell's riddles, Manny was coordinating with the Division to rescue \"Glasses\" from resurgent Hyena forces. While they extracted \"Glasses\", the Division also learned that Black Tusk are supplying the Hyenas once again. Therefore, Manny coordinated the Agents in eliminating \"Bichon\", preventing the faction from rebuilding its Council.\n\n=== Cassandra ===\nThe intel drops that Kelso left behind led Manny and the Division to Roosevelt Island, where the agents were sent there to secure Faye Lau's Mobile SHD Server. After eliminating the True Sons personnel, they recovered the server and learn from the ECHO that reveals that President Ellis deliberately gave his security clearance for The Ark to Faye Lau, as insurance policy to prevent Natalya Sokolova having it. This surprised Manny a bit, but nonetheless, he ordered the agents to extract the server. Though suddenly, he heard a gunshot.\n\nHe intercepts the gunshot to the Sick Bay, where he found his friend Kelso, and was shocked of her murdering Doctor Joshua Summers. However, it quickly wore off when he saw Bardon Schaeffer waking up from his 2-month coma, and helped him up on his feet alongside Kelso..\n\n== Debriefing with Schaeffer ==\nWith Bardon Schaeffer awake and Kelso going low-profile, Manny wasted no time in putting him to debrief with the former BTSU commander. Those debriefings were later heard by Division agents while they were busy securing areas across Washington, D.C to locate their deep-cover asset embedded in Sokolov Concern. In these debriefings, Manny would learn the full extent of Natalya Sokolova's plans\n\n=== The Code Name ===\nIn this debriefing, Manny asks Bardon Schaeffer if he's still committed to the mission, and he still is despite the 2 months that went to waste. Manny then apologizes over what happened to Faye Lau. While Schaeffer told him cleanly that Division agents were supposed to take him alive and conscious, Manny explains that was the case, but Dr. Joshua Summers put the former BTSU officer in a medically-induced coma, and he had no reason to suspect the doctor was a mole, until he learned too late.\n\n=== The Bunker ===\nThe debriefing continues with Schaeffer revealing that Black Tusk's bunkers are almost everywhere across the United States. Almost being the keyword, as most bunkers can be reached in less than a day's walk, half a day's drive, or an hour or two on a helo, depending on the weather condition\n\nManny muses how to compete against Black Tusk's bunkers, which Schaeffer answers it's not possible, hence why he and his Rogue allies were trying to shut them down. Manny understood they were after Black Tusk's Network, DIAMOND. In that case, Schaeffer emphasizes by taking down the Diamond Network, they can shut down Black Tusk's bunkers and all of Nat's tech.\n\n=== The Plan ===\nNext up, Schaeffer explained in order to take down the Network for good, they need Claire, \"the football, and the Presidential Clearance. Manny comments that he doesn't, while Schaeffer argued otherwise, which confuses the former as he understood it's not possible to have the clearance without being POTUS. This led to Schaeffer asking him in frustration if he really asked Kelso what the Cassandra mission was about, which Manny thought it was waking him up.\n\nSchaeffer then explains that he's \"The Key\" to Black Tusk bunkers, not the Ortiz Robotics Network. And if Faye finished her mission and Ellis died, then she got that clearance from him. This made Manny realize that Faye's watch has the clearance, and then explained that Kelso has it, and she's keeping a low-profile to not put a target on The White House.\n\nWhen asked by Schaeffer if they talked about this in a comms-free space, Manny confirmed it as Kelso insisted no comms, wi-fi killers, and EMPs to keep their conversation from recording, just in case.\n\n=== The Recruiter ===\nThe next topic involved Brian Johnson (aka The Recruiter). Schaeffer confirmed to Manny that he was supposed to warn the Division about Johnson being a Hunter, though couldn't due to hsi coma. Manny admits he screwed up, as he let his guard down with Johnson. Schaeffer assures it's not his fault, as Brian Johnson is a good and trustworthy man who wanted to do the right thing. It's just so happened that he got manipulated, and found himself on the wrong end of the stick. And like everyone else, he wanted a rebuilt and safe society to raise a family in.\n\nManny comments things would be simpler ifeveryone agreed what a rebuilt and safe society should look like, though Schaeffer argues that people used to argue whether they should drink a cow milk, or how they should raise their children, which are problems that no civilization managed to solve thus far.\n\nManny understood his point, mentioning his upcoming role as a Dad. Schaeffer was in the dark about this, so he congratulated him and asked how he's handling it. Manny admits he's nervous, but committed, as it is a job he's not planning to quit on.\n\n=== The Traitor ===\nNext up was President Andrew Ellis. Manny confirmed to Schaeffer that Division agents recovered the Camp White Oak's ECHO, though \"Glasses\" scrubbed some of the data, so ANNA had to do the transcripts. He also confirmed that Ellis willingly gave his clearance to Faye Lau and ordered her to kill him, so he wouldn't be forced to take it back.\n\nManny was puzzled when Schaeffer showed a bit of admiration for the deceased POTUS, asking him if they're talking about the same Ellis. Schaeffer confirms his notion, talking Ellis as once Speaker of the House, who made a deal with the devil.\n\nManny disagreed with Schaeffer's notion of Natalya Sokolova being the devil, even when Schaeffer talked how she took over her father's business before he could replace her with her half-brother, Felix, then later manipulating the Division to killing him. His assertion is that Nat is a traitor, and that traitors can be held accountable or killed.\n\n== Personality ==\n\nThroughout the crisis, Manny has worked his way through attrition. With JTF Command evacuated from D.C., he's become the leader for the JTF as well as being coordinator for the Division and their operations across the city.  This causes him some conflict between his duties as a leader for the people he's supposed to protect and coordinating Division agents. As an example, Jack Arnold's, Mel, chewed him out when Manny didn't prioritize rescuing Jack and made excuses. \n\nManny is not without flaws. For instance, he made poor judgement during the attack on Camp White Oak to capture President Ellis when he sent a JTF unit at the bridge on the way to White Oak, when he should've been aware that Black Tusk anticipated the arrival and rigged explosives to counter-attack.\n\nDuring his time in the JTF, he struck a friendship with Frederick Lewis as they served in the same unit. That friendship went sour, when Lewis joined the True Sons. Later, when Lewis came in to help the Division against General Anderson, Manny wasn't keen to help as he was still hurt by his friend's betrayal. But he managed to put this aside and let his old friend into the fold. When Lewis died during the Black Tusk's attack on the White House, Manny moured for him, giving his dog-tags to Ransom as a way to remember him.\n\nAt some point, after Mari Singh and her Aquarium community were rescued, Manny struck a relationship with Mari, even conceiving a child. This puts immense pressure on Manny, given his duties and the fact that he's becoming a dad. During a session with Dr. Mitchell Billings, Manny was worried how his child would see him.\n\nIf there's one thing that could define Manny's flaws, its his obsessive need to control everything. He gets upset or angry when things happen outside of his control, and couldn't do anything to stop it. As an example, he was upset when his friend, Agent Alani Kelso, joined with Aaron Keener. And only calmed down when his lover Mari helped him realized that Kelso is only working with Keener to intercept Black Tusk's AI, DIAMOND.\n\nGiven the stakes and the war to come, time will tell how Manny will deal with it and the aftermath. While he allowed the  Keener into the White House, Manny put the rogue agent a cell as he's not yet willing to trust him yet.\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite Manny being in his late 20s, his face is weathered and his side-hairs are greying due the amount of stress he goes in his work.\n\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Appearances ==\n*''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]''\n[[Category:People]]\n[[Category:The Division 2]]\n[[Category:Division Agents]]\n[[Category:NPC]]",
